J	BACD199799449318		Article		Patch exploitation in a producer-scrounger system: Test of a hypothesis using flocks of spice finches (Lonchura punctulata)		Beauchamp, Guy; Giraldeau, Luc-Alain				Behavioral Ecology		1997		8	1	54-59	54	59	English						1	6	Group foraging allows individuals (scroungers) to obtain food discovered by others (producers). Producer-scrounger game models typically overlook the costs and benefits of patch exploitation, assuming instead that producers and scroungers abandon patches simultaneously once depletion occurs. Here we develop an extension of the marginal value theorem of patch exploitation that includes the producer-scrounger dynamics and examine the propensity of a producer to abandon its patch before depletion once scroungers arrive. We predict that early departures should occur more often when expected searching time decreases and when competition intensity in the patch increases. Competition intensity is expected to increase when more scroungers are present or when patches are smaller. We tested these predictions using a within-subject experimental design with six captive flocks of spice finches (Lonchura punctulata), each composed of one producer and three scroungers. As predicted, producers abandoned their food discoveries more frequently once scroungers arrived when searching time was short, when more scroungers were present, and when patches were small. The results show that the producers of a patch often leave as scroungers join their food discoveries because the payoffs from leaving exceed those from staying.	Dep.

However there is a surprising paucity of experimental evidence in wild populations. Here, we examine producer-scrounger games in five subpopulations of birds feeding at a socially learnt foraging task. Over four weeks, a bimodal distribution of producers and scroungers emerged in all areas, with pronounced and consistent individual tactic specialization persisting over 3 years. Tactics were unrelated to exploratory personality, but correlated with latency to contact and learn the foraging task, with the late arrivers and slower learners more likely to adopt the scrounging role. Additionally, the social environment was also important: at the broad scale, larger subpopulations with a higher social density contained proportionally more scroungers, while within subpopulations scroungers tended to be central in the social network and be observed in larger foraging flocks. This study thus provides a rare example of a stable, dimorphic distribution of producer-scrounger tactics in a wild population. It further gives support across multiple scales for a major prediction of social foraging theory; that the frequency of scroungers increases with group size.	Aplin, L.

The producer-scrounger (PS) game predicts how frequently this phenomenon of food parasitism should occur. The game assumes: (1) at any moment all individuals can unambiguously be categorized as either playing producer (searching for undiscovered food resources) or scrounger (searching for exploitation opportunities), and (2) the payoffs received from the scrounger tactic are negatively frequency dependent; a scrounger does better than a producer when the scrounger tactic is rare, but worse when it is common. No study to date has shown that the payoffs of producer and scrounger conform to the game's assumptions or that groups of foragers reach the predicted stable equilibrium frequency (SEF) of scrounger, whereby both tactics obtain the same payoff. The current study of three captive flocks of spice finches, Lonchura punctulata, provides the first test of the PS game using an apparatus in which both assumptions of the PS game are met. The payoffs to the scrounger, measured as feeding rate (seeds/s), were highly negatively frequency dependent on the frequency of scrounger. The feeding rate for scrounger declined linearly while the rate for producer either declined only slightly or not at all with increasing scrounger frequency. When given the opportunity to alternate between tactics, the birds changed their use of each, such that the group converged on the predicted SEF of scrounger after 5-8 days of testing. Individuals in this study, therefore, demonstrated sufficient plasticity in tactic use such that the flock foraged at the SEF of scrounger.

To maximize food returns, producers should distance themselves from potential competitors whereas scroungers should increase proximity to potential producers. We investigated the extent to which playing one or the other tactic affected an individual's location in captive flocks of ground-feeding spice finches (Lonchura punctulata) as they foraged for hidden clumps of food on an aviary floor. We constrained some individuals to use the producer tactic by pre-training them to find food hidden under lids. Constrained producers foraged significantly further from the center of flocks than constrained scroungers. Flocks with many scroungers were significantly more compact than flocks with fewer scroungers. The results are consistent with published simulations of spatially explicit producer-scrounger models and suggest that the use of producer and scrounger foraging tactics be included as a factor that affects an individual's position within foraging groups.

These foraging advantages rely on the occurrence of 'joining': feeding from food discovered or captured by others. Joining occurs in most social species but the assumptions underlying its analysis have been clarified only recently, giving rise to two classes of model: information-sharing and producer-scrounger models. Recent experimental evidence suggests that joining in ground-feeding birds might be best analysed as a producer-scrounger game, with some intriguing consequences for the spatial distribution of foragers and patch exploitation.

Most producer-scrounger models assume that birds are flexible in using tactics in response to changing conditions and that foragers are phenotypically identical. Individual differences and flexibility in tactic use were investigated in zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata) foraging in two flocks of different composition. Birds varied widely in their use of tactics, and individual differences proved consistent both within and between flocks. Significant adjustments in tactic use occurred from one flock to the other. Results suggest that tactic use in zebra finches foraging in small flocks is characterized by consistency and flexibility. Individual differences in tactic use demonstrate the need to examine further the consequences of phenotypic variation in producer-scrounger models.

However, the empirical testing of such models has generally been restricted to indoor aviary experiments. Here, we examine the social foraging tactics of naturally foraging wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). Thirty-six adult baboons from 2 groups were observed during full-day follows: Data from nearly 10 000 foraging events were analyzed using cross-classified, generalized linear mixed models. First, as predicted by producer-scrounger models, we show that baboons altered their foraging tactics in accordance with food patch size and spatial position in the group. Second, we show that the relative characteristics of cofeeding individuals were crucial: In particular, among females, individuals were more likely to scrounge from foraging neighbors who were subordinate and with whom they had a strong social affiliation. However, we found no effect of kinship. Finally, we found that female reproductive state influenced female foraging tactics (females scrounged more from male neighbors when pregnant and less when fertile), but the reproductive state of female neighbors had no such effects on male foraging tactics. These results suggest that, in addition to broad-scale ecological and group-level influences, a myriad of social and reproductive factors can shape producer-scrounger dynamics for wild animals living in complex social groups.

Tactic use in producer-scrounger games is partly flexible but individuals tend to show consistency in tactic use under different conditions suggesting that personality might play a role in tactic use in producer-scrounger games. Here we studied the use of producing and scrounging tactics by bold and shy barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis), where boldness is a personality trait known to be repeatable over time in this species. We defined individuals as bold, shy or intermediate based on two novel object tests. We scored the frequency of finding food patches (the outcome of investing in producing) and joining patches (the outcome of investing in scrounging) by bold and shy individuals and their feeding time. Shy individuals had a higher frequency of joining than bold individuals, demonstrating for the first time that personality is associated with tactic use in a producer-scrounger game. Bold individuals tended to spend more time feeding than shy individuals. Our results highlight the importance of including individual behavioural variation in models of producer-scrounger games.

One way to describe this behaviour is with the producer-scrounger (PS) model, where scroungers use social interaction to obtain food discovered by producers. Mexican jays (Aphelocoma ultramarina) are a group-foraging species with a linear dominance hierarchy. We studied interactions in a free-living foraging group to determine (1) if foraging interactions can be explained with the PS model, (2) if these roles are consistent and (3) if dominance or relatedness affects joining frequency. We recorded board-flipping, eating, and joining events during sets of feeding trials. We show that Mexican jays use PS roles and that these roles were consistent through many trials, but might have changed between trial sets. Relatedness and frequency of joining were not correlated. Dominance influenced joining in that joining was more likely to occur between birds with a larger difference in their dominance rank. In contrast to other studies, our results suggest that this effect is mediated through joiner preference. Scroungers preferentially joined birds of lower dominance rank and high search activity. Producers with these qualities had fewer eating events with full access to seeds, suggesting that scrounging exacts a cost on producers.

(marmots@ucla.edu)				Animal Behaviour		2021	FEB 2021	172		1-7	1	7	English						1	4	When social animals forage together, they may engage in frequency-dependent strategies either as producers, those who acquire food with their own energy, or as scroungers, those who feed on what the producers discover. An individual's choice of strategy may depend on the frequency of strategies within the group, or it may depend on the individual's own traits. Most of our understanding of producer-scrounger relationships comes from highly social species, but we may gain different insights by studying less social species. We used novel puzzle box experiments to study social foraging relationships and identify the traits associated with strategy choice in facultatively social yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. We found that marmots had consistent strategies as either producers or scroungers. Furthermore, several individuals specialized as scroungers, following the producers to the puzzle box before other scroungers. However, their roles were only associated with sex (males were more likely to produce), and not with age, boldness or dominance rank. Marmots' lack of trait-regulated foraging roles may be associated with their relatively abundant and not-entirely defensible food, or may emerge from their lack of obligate social structure. We discuss how multiple factors may explain variation in social foraging behaviour. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The joining decision has been modeled as a producer-scrounger game where the producer strategy consists of searching for one's food and the scrounger strategy consists of searching for food discovered by others. Previous models revealed that the evolutionarily stable proportion of scrounging mostly depends on the fraction of each food patch available only to its producer. These early models are static and state independent and are therefore unable to explore whether the time of day, the animal's state, and the degree of predation hazard influence an individual's decision of whether to use the producer or scrounger strategy. To investigate these issues, we developed a state-dependent dynamic producer-scrounger game model. The model predicts that, early in the day, low reserves promote a preference for the scrounger strategy, while the same condition late in the day favors the use of the producer strategy. Under rich and clumped food, the availability of scrounging can improve the daily survival of any average group member. The model suggests only weak effects of predation hazard on the use of scrounging. Future developments should consider the effects of dominance asymmetries and allowing foragers a choice between foraging alone or in a group harboring an evolutionarily stable frequency of scrounger.

If searching for food and searching for exploitation opportunities within a group are mutually exclusive alternatives, the decision to use one or the other is modeled as a producer-scrounger game because the value of each alternative is frequency dependent. Stochastic producer-scrounger models generally assume that producer provides a more variable and uncertain reward than does the scrounger and hence is a riskier foraging alternative. Socially foraging animals that are attempting to reduce their risk of starvation should therefore alter their use of producer and scrounger alternatives in response to changes in energy budget. We observed flocks of nutmeg mannikins (L. punctulata) foraging in an indoor aviary to determine whether their use of producer and scrounger alternatives were risk sensitive. Analyses of the foraging rewards of three flocks of seven birds confirm that producer is a riskier foraging strategy than is scrounger, although the difference in risk is rather small. We then submitted two other flocks to two different energy budgets and observed the foraging decision of four focal birds in each flock. All but one bird increased their relative use of the riskier producer strategy in the low food reserve treatment, but the overall use of producer did not differ significantly between treatments, providing evidence for a small but consistent effect.

Previous experimental inquiries have demonstrated that individuals vary in their tendency to play either tactic but the extent to which individual factors influence variation in foraging behavior are little studied. In the present study, we have assessed the influence of natural variation in body condition on the differential use of social foraging tactics and their resulting payoffs in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). The producer tactic was found to yield more consistent and predictable rewards across trials than the scrounger tactic. The use of producer was related to reduced variation in food intake and an increased amount of food consumed. We found that poor-condition birds were more likely to produce and so consumed more seeds than good-condition birds. The results are consistent with theoretical models of variance-sensitive social foraging but suggest that scrounging may not represent a variance-averse option in all situations. We propose that in a producer-scrounger context, the variance-averse option may depend on group size and food clumping. Finally, we discuss our results in relation to interindividual differences in metabolism and behavior.

(hall.carolyn_l@uqam.ca) ; Giraldeau, Luc-Alain (giraldeau.luc-alain@uqam.ca)				Animal Behaviour		2015	JUL 2015	105		181-186	181	186	English						0	16	The use of evolutionary game theory and the concept of the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) have come under criticism lately because game-theoretic models are often constrained to overly simplistic situations. Furthermore, game-theoretic models commit the behavioural gambit, that is, they assume that individuals have some unspecified decision mechanism that duplicates the outcomes that would be expected from natural selection acting on genetic alternatives. The producer-scrounger game is an ideal illustration of the criticisms aimed at the game-theoretic approach; it has generated a number of game-theoretic models that make specific predictions for highly simplified foraging conditions. Simulation models of the producer-scrounger game that incorporate the linear operator learning rule, however, have been more successful in replicating the empirical results. In these models, groups of animals forage for patches of food using a linear operator learning rule. The linear operator model furthermore provides a new prediction about the effect of variation in patch quality within a producer-scrounger game. Current models based on evolutionarily stable strategies and empirical investigations have always assumed or used patches of uniform quality. Yet patches vary in quality and some environments are potentially more variable than others. The linear operator model predicts an increase in scrounging behaviour when patch quality varies. We tested this prediction using captive foraging flocks of male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in two treatments with variable and nonvariable patch quality. The results show that as individuals have more experience in the variable environment, they increase their scrounging behaviour. Linear operator models may therefore provide a general and empirically valid means of exploring the outcome of animal decisions in social foraging situations too complex to be addressed by evolutionary game models.

The foraging benefits of group living include increased efficiency and reduced need for vigilance, but social foraging can also encourage theft of captured prey from conspecifics. The payoffs of stealing prey from others (scrounging) versus capturing prey (producing) may depend not only on the frequency of each foraging strategy in the group but also on an individual's ability to steal. By observing the foraging behavior of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), we found that, within a group, relatively smaller coho acted primarily as producers and took longer to handle prey, and were therefore more likely to be targeted by scroungers than relatively larger coho. Further, our observations suggest that the frequency of scrounging may be higher when groups contained individuals of different sizes. Based on these observations, we developed a model of phenotype-limited producer-scrounger dynamics, in which rates of stealing were structured by the relative size of producers and scroungers within the foraging group. Model simulations show that when the success of stealing is positively related to body size, relatively large predators should tend to be scroungers while smaller predators should be producers. Contrary to previous models, we also found that, under certain conditions, producer and scrounger strategies could coexist for both large and small phenotypes. Large scroungers tended to receive the highest payoff, suggesting that producer-scrounger dynamics may result in an uneven distribution of benefits among group members thatunder the right conditionscould entrench social positions of dominance.

How individuals learn to allocate effort in foraging games involving frequency-dependent payoffs has been little examined. The performance of three different learning rules was investigated in several types of habitats in each of two population games. Learning rules allow individuals to weigh information about the past and the present and to choose among alternative patterns of behaviour. In the producer-scrounger game, foragers use producer to locate food patches and scrounger to exploit the food discoveries of others. In the ideal free distribution game, foragers that experience feeding interference from companions distribute themselves among heterogeneous food patches. In simulations of each population game, the use of different learning rules induced large variation in foraging behaviour, thus providing a tool to assess the relevance of each learning rule in experimental systems. Rare mutants using alternative learning rules often successfully invaded populations of foragers using other rules indicating that some learning rules are not stable when pitted against each other. Learning rules often closely approximated optimal behaviour in each population game suggesting that stimulus-response learning of contingencies created by foraging companions could be sufficient to perform at near-optimal level in two population games.

Proceedings of the Royal Society Biological Sciences Series B		2009	NOV 7 2009	276	1674	3853-3862	3853	3862	English						0	23	Technology (i.e. tools, methods of cultivation and domestication, systems of construction and appropriation, machines) has increased the vital rates of humans, and is one of the defining features of the transition from Malthusian ecological stagnation to a potentially perpetual rising population growth. Maladaptations, on the other hand, encompass behaviours, customs and practices that decrease the vital rates of individuals. Technology and maladaptations are part of the total stock of culture carried by the individuals in a population. Here, we develop a quantitative model for the coevolution of cumulative adaptive technology and maladaptive culture in a 'producer-scrounger' game, which can also usefully be interpreted as an 'individual-social' learner interaction. Producers (individual learners) are assumed to invent new adaptations and maladaptations by trial-and-error learning, insight or deduction, and they pay the cost of innovation. Scroungers (social learners) are assumed to copy or imitate (cultural transmission) both the adaptations and maladaptations generated by producers. We show that the coevolutionary dynamics of producers and scroungers in the presence of cultural transmission can have a variety of effects on population carrying capacity. From stable polymorphism, where scroungers bring an advantage to the population (increase in carrying capacity), to periodic cycling, where scroungers decrease carrying capacity, we find that selection-driven cultural innovation and transmission may send a population on the path of indefinite growth or to extinction.

Relying on a recent mathematical model, we here test the prediction that the emergence of differences in within-individual consistency is related to the sequential access to resources in a frequency-dependent foraging game. To this end we used flocks of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) engaged in a producer-scrounger foraging game. Tactic investment (i.e., the proportion of hops with the head down) significantly predicted successful tactic use (i.e., the proportion of seeds produced). In support of predictions, we found that individuals that arrived first at a foraging area were more consistent in both their investment into and their use of the producer tactic. Also, birds in higher body condition were less consistent in their producer tactic use. These results provide the first evidence that variation in behavioral consistency can emerge through the sequential access to resources in a frequency-dependent game. They also highlight a potential physiological cost of behavioral flexibility. Our findings suggest an explanation for the link between personality traits and social information use.

However, individual differences in social contexts have received less attention. We explored the consistency and temporal persistence of individual differences in tactic use in a producer-scrounger foraging game using two sets of flocks of wild-caught nutmeg mannikins, Lonchura punctulata. With both sets of birds, we observed significant individual differences in tactic use that persisted under different food distributions and when flock members were reunited at a 6-month interval with the same flockmates but not when flock members were different. In another experiment, in which birds with high-scrounging profiles were made to forage in the same flock, the corporate frequency of scrounging was no higher, and the intake rate no lower than in flocks made up of intermediate- or low-frequency scroungers. Taken together our experiments suggest that persistent individual differences can arise from dynamics that are peculiar to the group in which they occur, underlining the importance of companions' identity in determining tactic use in this game. Behavioural plasticity can erase idiosyncratic individual differences in games with frequency-dependent payoffs when group composition changes.

Using food discovered by others can be described as a producer-scrounger, frequency-dependent game. In the game, scroungers (parasitic individuals) do better than producers (food finders) when scroungers are rare in the group, but they do worse when scroungers are common. When the individuals' payoffs do not depend on their phenotype (i.e. a symmetric game), this strong negative frequency dependence leads to a mixed stable solution where both alternatives obtain equal payoffs. Here, we address the question of how differences in social status in a dominance hierarchy influence the individuals' decision to play producer or scrounger in small foraging groups. We model explicitly the food intake rate of each individual in a dominance-structured foraging group, then calculate the Nash equilibrium for them. Our model predicts that only strong differences in competitive ability will influence the use of producing or scrounging tactics in small foraging groups; dominants will mainly play scrounger and subordinates will mostly use producer. Since the differences in competitive ability of different-ranking individuals likely depend on the economic defendability of food, our model provides a step towards the integration of social foraging and resource defence theories.

While experimental evidence in the producer-scrounger game suggests that learned strategy choice may be common, a recent theoretical analysis demonstrated that learning by only some individuals prevents learning from evolving in others. Here, however, we model learning explicitly, and demonstrate that learning can easily evolve in the whole population. We used an agent-based evolutionary simulation of the producer-scrounger game to test the success of two general learning rules for strategy choice. We found that learning was eventually acquired by all individuals under a sufficient degree of environmental fluctuation, and when players were phenotypically asymmetric. In the absence of sufficient environmental change or phenotypic asymmetries, the correct target for learning seems to be confounded by game dynamics, and innate strategy choice is likely to be fixed in the population. The results demonstrate that under biologically plausible conditions, learning can easily evolve in the whole population and that phenotypic asymmetry is important for the evolution of learned strategy choice, especially in a stable or mildly changing environment.

Journal of Animal Ecology		2021	NOV 2021	90	11				English						5	12	The producer-scrounger game is a key element of foraging ecology in many systems. Producing and scrounging typically covary negatively, but partitioning this covariance into contributions of individual plasticity and consistent between individual differences is key to understanding population-level consequences of foraging strategies. Furthermore, little is known about the role cognition plays in the producer-scrounger game. We investigated the role of cognition in these alternative foraging tactics in wild mixed-species flocks of great tits and blue tits, using a production learning task in which we measured individuals' speed of learning to visit the single feeder in an array that would provide them with a food reward. We also quantified the proportion of individuals' feeds that were scrounges ('proportion scrounged'); scrounging was possible if individuals visited immediately after a previous rewarded visitor. Three learning experiments-initial and two reversal learning-enabled us to estimate the repeatability and covariance of each foraging behaviour. First, we examined whether individuals learned to improve their scrounging success (i.e. whether they obtained food by scrounging when there was an opportunity to do so). Second, we quantified the repeatability of proportion scrounged, and asked whether proportion scrounged affected production learning speed among individuals. Third, we used multivariate analyses to partition within- and among-individual components of covariance between proportion scrounged and production learning speed. Individuals improved their scrounging success over time. Birds with a greater proportion scrounged took longer to learn their own rewarding feeder. Although multivariate analyses showed that covariance between proportion scrounged and learning speed was driven primarily by within-individual variation, that is, by behavioural plasticity, among-individual differences also played a role for blue tits. This is the first demonstration of a cognitive trait influencing producing and scrounging in the same wild system, highlighting the importance of cognition in the use of alternative resource acquisition tactics. The results of our covariance analyses suggest the potential for genetic differences in allocation to alternative foraging tactics, which are likely species- and system-dependent. They also point to the need to control for different foraging tactics when studying individual cognition in the wild.

J	BACD200100101644		Article	Literature Review	Breeding colonies as information centers: A reappraisal of information-based hypotheses using the producer-scrounger game		Barta, Zoltan; Giraldeau, Luc-Alain				Behavioral Ecology		2001	Mar.-Apr., 2001	12	2	121-127	121	127	English	print					0	28	One of the most cited hypotheses for the evolutionary advantages of colonial breeding proposes that colonies serve as a place of information exchange about the location of food-the information center hypothesis. Despite its popularity, the hypothesis generated considerable controversy over its predictions and role in the evolution of colonial breeding. As a consequence, the hypothesis still lingers on, despite numerous apparent falsifications from both observational and experimental approaches. The controversy has three roots: the unclear causal direction between coloniality and information center, the unrecognized distinction between colonial breeding and colonial roosting, and the use of an implicit group selectionist argument. Here we try to clarify this controversy by applying an entirely individual selection-based approach, the producer-scrounger game, to the information center hypothesis. Furthermore, we show how other information-based alternatives of the original information center hypothesis (e.g., local enhancement and recruitment center hypotheses) can be included in a common framework. Our model predicts that individuals relying on information transfer at the colony should be rather common in nature. This prediction is essentially unaltered by the inclusion of either local enhancement or recruitment center. On the other hand, the frequency of leading unknowledgeable individuals (the most accepted sign of information center) is expected to be very low. The model indicates that tests of information-based hypotheses should focus on the expected relative frequency of food-searching flights rather than the frequency of leading.

(jrs@liv.ac.uk)				IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation		2009	OCT 2009	13	5	973-990	973	990	English						4	114	Nature-inspired optimization algorithms, notably evolutionary algorithms (EAs), have been widely used to solve various scientific and engineering problems because of to their simplicity and flexibility. Here we report a novel optimization algorithm, group search optimizer (GSO), which is inspired by animal behavior, especially animal searching behavior. The framework is mainly based on the producer-scrounger model, which assumes that group members search either for "finding" (producer) or for "joining" (scrounger) opportunities. Based on this framework, concepts from animal searching behavior, e. g., animal scanning mechanisms, are employed metaphorically to design optimum searching strategies for solving continuous optimization problems. When tested against benchmark functions, in low and high dimensions, the GSO algorithm has competitive performance to other EAs in terms of accuracy and convergence speed, especially on high-dimensional multimodal problems. The GSO algorithm is also applied to train artificial neural networks. The promising results on three real-world benchmark problems show the applicability of GSO for problem solving.

One such situation involves cases where an animal can search for a new resource (produce) or join what others have already found (scrounge). A number of game-theoretic models have been proposed to predict the equilibrium combination of producer and scrounger strategists based on the evolutionarily stable strategy. However, each game model can only handle a few environmental parameters at a time and none address the flexible use of tactics that allows individuals to respond quickly and adaptively to changes in payoffs. In this study we propose an agent-based model using a linear operator learning rule as the decision mechanism. The model provides a unified framework from which to predict the effects on the expected equilibrium of producers and scroungers of group size, metabolic requirement, finder's advantage, food intake rate, cost of searching, cost of joining, patch encounter probability and patch richness. The simulation results replicate almost every producer-scrounger prediction and experimental result published to date such that the simulation provides a more general tool than any single game-theoretic model to predict behaviour under frequency-dependent conditions. The model furthermore allows us to develop a novel prediction about foraging behaviour in a more realistic environment of variable patch richness. By modelling the operation of a plausible decision rule, we can explore the validity of the behavioural gambit, the assumption that the unspecified decision mechanisms of game-theoretic models faithfully reproduce outcomes expected of natural selection operating over generations on fixed alternatives. We suggest that this simulation model can provide a tool for others to explore and predict the effect of more complex and hence realistic foraging conditions on individual levels of producer and scrounger use.

Producers generate opportunities to exploit resources; scroungers attempt to sequester some of the resources producers discover. We develop two models of producing and scrounging in foraging groups of fixed, finite size. In the producer-priority model scrounging reduces a producer's expected food intake, but the reduction does not depend on the exact number of scroungers in the group. In the scramble-competition model a producer's expected food intake always decreases as the number of scroungers increases. Treating each model as an N-person game, we find stable numbers of producers and scroungers for different group sizes, food densities, physiologically required food-intake levels, costs of scrounging, and competitive abilities of producers. Solutions to our models assume that strategic efficiency reduces the individual's probability of starving. Stochastic variation in our models arises because the amount of food discovered varies randomly, and because the allocation of food items among foragers within a clump may also vary randomly. Previous producer-scrounger models are deterministic; so our stochastic models make a series of new predictions. We also discuss the importance of phenotypic plasticity in modeling complex organisms' social behavior, and examine possible co-operative restraints on scrounging.

The use of producer and scrounger strategies has been modelled as an alternative-option scramble which assumes strong negative frequency-dependence of the scrounger's pay-offs. We tested this assumption in a flock feeding situation by manipulating the proportion of scroungers in flocks of spice finches, Lonchura punctulata. In a first experiment we found that: (1) the food intake of scroungers, and to a lesser extent producers, was negatively affected by an increase in the proportion of scroungers; (2) the food intake of producers and scroungers was equal when the proportion of scroungers was small, suggesting that producers, who exploited 35.4% of their patches by scrounging were opportunistically adjusting their use of the strategies until the pay-offs equalized. In a second experiment we tested whether finches could vary their use of the two strategies in response to changes in foraging conditions brought about by an increase in the cost of producing. As predicted by the game, finches reduced their use of the producer strategy and increased their use of the scrounger strategy when the cost of producing increased. These results suggest that spice finches can alter their allocation to each foraging alternative by experience and that the producer-scrounger game is a realistic model for predicting group foraging decisions.

Indeed, personality shows heritable variation and has been linked to fitness in many species. However, the fitness effects of personality are highly variable within and between species. Furthermore, the nature of the causal influence of personality on an organism's fitness remains unclear so far. Competition has been proposed as a factor modulating this relationship. Thus, personality has been found to affect individual success in competition by interference in a few species, but its influence in scramble competition remains unexplored. We assessed exploratory tendencies (thought to be a key component of personality) in a model species, the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. In a first session, we formed foraging flocks composed of four individuals with different exploration scores, and allowed them to play producer-scrounger games repeatedly. During a second session, individuals were reassigned to different flocks to check for consistency in the influence of exploratory tendency across different social contexts. Exploratory tendency influenced individual feeding success during the first session but not during the second one. High-exploratory birds were less successful at finding food (i.e. playing the producer tactic) and consequently had a lower feeding success, but were presumably able to adjust their behaviour between sessions. We discuss our results in relation to the interactive effects of both personality and experience, and highlight the role of competition processes on the evolution of personality.

In a producer-scrounger (PS) system, foragers can either search for food themselves (play producer) or search for joining opportunities (play scrounger), but not both at the same time. Empirical evidence is accumulating to show that the joining decision of ground-feeding birds like nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura punctulata) can be modeled by a PS game. However some predictions remain to be tested. For instance, foragers are predicted to increase their use of the scrounger tactic as group size increases. Also, one consequence of the incompatibility between producer and scrounger tactics is that the per capita searching efficiency should decrease as the use of scrounger increases. I tested these predictions in an indoor aviary using four flocks of nutmeg mannikins. I manipulated the stable equilibrium frequency (SEF) of the scrounger tactic by varying group size and the finder's share. As predicted by PS games, birds increased their use of scrounger as group size increased. Also, the per capita interval between patch discoveries increased and the per capita finding rate decreased as conditions called for a higher SEF of scrounger. I discuss why the decreased searching efficiency observed likely follows from the incompatibility between producer and scrounger tactics rather than from artifacts of the conditions used or from any form of interference.

Prey exploited by predators engaged in a PS game could gain by evolving predator evasion tactics that shift the PS equilibrium of their predators towards a larger number of nonsearching scroungers. Prey can achieve this by imposing foraging costs that are specific to predators engaged in the producer strategy. Ye tested whether prey crypsis, a trait that has evolved as a demonstrably efficient strategy against solitary predators, imposed a producer-specific cost to group foragers that shifts PS equilibria towards more scrounging. We exposed four flocks of six nutmeg mannikins, Lonchura punctulata, small granivorous passerines that have been documented to play PS foraging games, to clumps of white millet seeds placed against one of two backgrounds that made them either cryptic or conspicuous. In three of four flocks, foraging under crytic conditions required more time to find food, resulted in more detection errors, had no effect on vigilance but significantly increased the frequency of scroungers at equilibrium. Having socially foraging predators may provide prey with an extra incentive to evolve producer-specific costs such as cryptic coloration.

By following foraging decisions made by beach-foraging crows, we assessed individual variability in strategy use, variables influencing the finder's share (when defined as the probability of retaining a prey item in the presence of food theft behaviour) and the benefits and costs of producing and scrounging. Data were collected using focal and all-occurrences scan sampling. Results indicated that more individuals were likely to use both producing and scrounging tactics than to be 'pure' producers. No pure scroungers were documented. When producers obtained scroungeable items, scroungers attempted to steal the item 46% of the time. Forty-one per cent of attempted scrounges were successful. Thus, producers suffered a 19% loss rate of scroungeable items to scroungers, although producers had access to large numbers of small (nonscroungeable) items. Although there were significantly more scroungeable prey items available at lower tides, there was no significant relationship between prey density and scrounge attempts or actual thefts. No ecological factors (group size, temperature, time of day, season) or individual characteristics (age, sex) influenced the probability of retaining prey. Prey retention was determined only by characteristics of the prey items: larger prey items or those with longer handling times were most likely to be stolen.

This has previously been the subject of a range of modelling approaches, one of which is the so called "producer-scrounger" model. In this model a producer finds a resource that takes some time to be consumed, and some time later a (generally) conspecific scrounger discovers the producer with its resource and potentially attempts to steal it. In this paper we consider a variant of this scenario where each individual can choose to invest an amount of energy into this contest, and the level of investment of each individual determines the probability of it winning the contest, but also the additional cost it has to bear. We analyse the model for a specific set of cost functions and maximum investment levels and show how the evolutionarily stable behaviour depends upon them. In particular we see that for high levels of maximum investment, the producer keeps the resource without a fight for concave cost functions, but for convex functions the scrounger obtains the resource (albeit at some cost).

We report the most complete demonstration to date of the applicability of the PS foraging game in a free-living animal, the Carib grackle (Quiscalus lugubris) of Barbados. As assumed by PS games, the payoffs obtained by scroungers were negatively frequency dependent. Experimentally, increasing the cost of scrounging led to a decrease in the observed proportion of scroungers, whereas raising the cost of producing increased the proportion of scroungers. Observations of marked birds revealed that group-level changes could be brought about by individual flexibility in tactic use. Despite consistent individual differences in tactic use, most birds used both tactics and could alter their use of producing and scrounging when conditions changed. We found no difference in the payoffs obtained by producers and scroungers, suggesting a symmetrical game equilibrium. Our results call for testing the PS foraging game in a broader range of biological systems that include different types of scrounging behavior (e.g., scramble, stealthful, or aggressive scrounging) as well as the exploitation of different phases of food production (e.g., searching, handling).

Animal Behaviour		2013	JUN 2013	85	6	1261-1269	1261	1269	English						3	137	Socially foraging animals can search for resources themselves (produce) or exploit the discoveries made by others (scrounge). The extensive literature on producer-scrounger dynamics has mainly focused on scramble competition over readily accessible resources, thereby largely neglecting the variety of scrounging techniques individuals may use as well as the role of investment in food handling. Furthermore, although individual differences in boldness and social factors such as dominance have been described to influence foraging tactics, their potential interplay and effect in foraging contexts beyond the conventional producer-scrounger game remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between social-foraging tactic use and dominance, pair bonds and boldness in a foraging experiment focused on food handling and alternative scrounging tactics. We conducted a producer-scrounger experiment in a captive group of rooks in which individuals could produce by pulling up baited strings, or scrounge by retrieving fallen food items or joining a producer. There were three key findings: (1) dominant rooks adopted the producer tactic more often and more successfully than subordinates; (2) producing and scrounging by tolerance led to mixed benefits to paired birds; (3) bold birds scrounged by retrieving more often than shy birds. Importantly, individuals were highly consistent in their tactic use across conditions differing in food availability.

Learning provides a mechanism for tracking changing conditions and it has frequently been predicted to supplant fixed behaviour in shifting environments; yet few studies have examined the evolution of learning specifically in a game-theoretic context. We present a model that examines the evolution of learning in a frequency-dependent context created by a producer-scrounger game, where producers search for their own resources and scroungers usurp the discoveries of producers. We ask whether a learning mutant that can optimize its use of producer and scrounger to local conditions can invade a population of non-learning individuals that play producer and scrounger with fixed probabilities. We find that learning provides an initial advantage but never evolves to fixation. Once a stable equilibrium is attained, the population is always made up of a majority of fixed players and a minority of learning individuals. This result is robust to variation in the initial proportion of fixed individuals, the rate of within-and between-generation environmental change, and population size. Such learning polymorphisms will manifest themselves in a wide range of contexts, providing an important element leading to behavioural syndromes.

For both, small and large groups, the number of production opportunities per capita was equal. Foraging strategies were classified as either production (opening gates with food) or scrounging (following conspecifics). Small groups showed a higher proportion of producers than large groups and required less time to deplete the food. The proportion of producing and scrounging responses yields to equilibrium between their payoffs. Producing and scrounging were highly correlated with different prior responses. Also, the relative frequency of producing and scrounging associated activities correlated with the time spent consuming food procured by each activity. It is possible that a simple outcome-strategy feedback mechanism mediates the choice of prior activities and procurement responses.

It is usually invoked in the context of challenges arising from complex intragroup structures, hierarchies, and alliances. However, a fundamental aspect of group living remains largely unexplored as a driving force in cognitive evolution: the competition between individuals searching for resources (producers) and conspecifics that parasitize their findings (scroungers). In populations of social foragers, abilities that enable scroungers to steal by outsmarting producers, and those allowing producers to prevent theft by outsmarting scroungers, are likely to be beneficial and may fuel a cognitive arms race. Using analytical theory and agent-based simulations, we present a general model for such a race that is driven by the producer-scrounger game and show that the race's plausibility is dramatically affected by the nature of the evolving abilities. If scrounging and scrounging avoidance rely on separate, strategy-specific cognitive abilities, arms races are short-lived and have a limited effect on cognition. However, general cognitive abilities that facilitate both scrounging and scrounging avoidance undergo stable, long-lasting arms races. Thus, ubiquitous foraging interactions may lead to the evolution of general cognitive abilities in social animals, without the requirement of complex intragroup structures.

In the recent literature, two alternative producer-scrounger (P-S) models have been proposed, one rate-maximizing, the other risk-sensitive. Their predictions differ about the effect of food clump density on the equilibrium proportional use of scrounger in a group. The rate-maximizing model predicts no effect, whereas the risk-sensitive model predicts that the proportional use of scrounger should increase with food clump density. These predictions were tested using wild-caught European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, in an indoor aviary. Increased food clump density resulted in significant increases in the proportional use of scrounger. Proportional use of scrounger was negatively related to food intake variance as assumed by the risk-sensitive model. Thus, scrounger is a risk-averse foraging tactic, and starlings used it in a risk-sensitive fashion. The risk-sensitive model was further challenged by testing its prediction concerning daily food requirement. When producer has a low competitive efficiency, as was found in these starlings, the risk-sensitive model predicts weakly positive effects, if any, of increased requirement on proportional use of scrounger. Results were consistent with this prediction. A significant number of starlings showed consistently positive effects of requirement on proportional use of scrounger, but the magnitude of this increase was non-significant. The results of both experiments taken together show that the proportional use of scrounger tactics within foraging groups may be a risk-sensitive, rather than a rate-maximizing, foraging tactic.

Since individual differences in learning ability could be a source of differences in behavioural plasticity, the frequency dependence of payoffs within a foraging group may permit the coexistence of both plastic, fast-learning individuals and nonplastic, slow-learning individuals; in a frequency-dependent context the adjustments of a few benefit all. In this study, we investigated whether individuals that learned faster in a simple associative learning task were also more likely to adjust their behaviour in a social foraging game context than their slower-learning groupmates. We measured the associative learning ability of female Bengalese finches, Lonchura striata domestica, in a colour discrimination task and their degree of behavioural plasticity in tactic use when foraging conditions called for changes in the flock's producer-scrounger equilibrium. We found that behavioural plasticity was affected by learning speed. However, in contrast to our expectation, the slower learners were most plastic. We argue that behavioural plasticity in the producer-scrounger game context may require learning that is different from colour matching. We also propose that our results may be related to the fast-slow continuum; being proactive or fast and inaccurate could favour being responsive in simple asocial contexts while being reactive or slow and accurate could favour being plastic in more complex social contexts. Future empirical studies need to compare differences in behavioural plasticity in tactic use with learning speed measured in other types of learning tasks and with personality traits relevant to the fast-slow continuum.

We tested whether group formation by a kleptoparasitic fish, the western buffalo bream (Kyphosus cornelii), fit the predictions of five social foraging models. Two aggregation economy models assumed that there was some benefit to grouping shared by group members, such as reduced predation risk or increased ability to gain access to resources. These models and a third, the dispersion (ideal free) economy model, assumed that kleptoparasites had perfect information regarding the quality of opportunities for kleptoparasitism. The other two models did not make this assumption. These producer-scrounger models assumed that some kleptoparasites (producers) discovered opportunities, while others used producers to reduce the costs of foraging. These last two models differed in whether foragers could estimate the state of current opportunities for kleptoparasitism. We compared typical group size, and the influence of group size on intake rate and the success of kleptoparasitic attempts, with the predictions of these models. We found that typical group size was larger during periods when opportunities for kleptoparasitism were poor than when good and that there was no influence of group size on the likelihood that the group was successful at kleptoparasitizing. Individual intake rate declined with group size for small group sizes, but increased with group size in large groups. However, large groups were rare. For small groups, only a producer-scrounger model allowing foragers to update their information could not be rejected. For large groups, neither that model nor the aggregation economy with foraging benefits model could be rejected. We compare these results with those of other studies of kleptoparasitic groups.

While these alternative behaviours are well documented, it is not clear to what extent an individual's tendency to forage independently or to follow others is under genetic control or rather is affected by experience. To examine whether hand-reared juveniles can learn to prefer using a producer or a scrounger tactic, we hand-reared house sparrow, Passer domesticus, nestlings that upon. edging were assigned to one of two training groups; the first was expected to enhance joining ( scrounging) behaviour and the second to enhance searching ( producing) behaviour. In the first group, fledglings were imprinted on a parent model ( stuffed female sparrow) that visited locations containing food. In the second group,fledglings were imprinted on a parent model that visited locations containing no food, while food was available in different locations. At the end of a 5-day training phase, all fledglings were released into a shared aviary, and their social foraging tendencies were measured. We found that fledglings from the first group used significantly more joining behaviour than fledglings from the second group, suggesting that an individual whose early experience positively reinforced joining behaviour is more likely to later become a joiner. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence for the effect of learning on the choice between social foraging strategies in the context of the producere scrounger game.

While it is well known that vultures use intraspecific social information as they forage, the possibility of inter-guild social information transfer and the resulting multi-species social dilemmas has not been explored. Here, we use data on arrival times at carcasses to show that such social information transfer occurs, with raptors acting as producers of information and vultures acting as scroungers of information. We develop a game-theoretic model to show that competitive asymmetry, whereby vultures dominate raptors at carcasses, predicts this evolutionary outcome. We support this theoretical prediction using empirical data from competitive interactions at carcasses. Finally, we use an individual-based model to show that these producer-scrounger dynamics lead to vultures being vulnerable to declines in raptor populations. Our results show that social information transfer can lead to important non-trophic interactions among species and highlight important potential links among social evolution, community ecology and conservation biology. With vulture populations suffering global declines, our study underscores the importance of ecosystem-based management for these endangered keystone species.

However, parasitic foraging strategy often emerges in a group. The optimal parasitic policy has given rise to the producer-scrounger (PS) game model, in which producers search for food patches, and scroungers parasitize the discovered patches. The N-persons PS game model constructed by Vickery et al. (1991. Producers, scroungers, and group foraging. American Naturalist 137, 847-863) predicts the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) of frequency of producers ((q) over cap) that depends on the advantage of producers and the number of foragers in a group. However, the model assumes that the number of discovered patches in one time unit never exceeds one. In reality, multiple patches could be found in one time unit. In the present study, we relax this assumption and assumed that the number of discovered patches depends on the producers' variable encounter rate with patches (lambda). We show that (q) over cap strongly depends on lambda within a feasible range, although it still depends on the advantage of producer and the number of foragers in a group. The basic idea of PS game is the same as the information sharing (parasitism), because scroungers are also thought to parasitize informations of locations of food patches. Horn (1968) indicated the role of information-parasitism in animal aggregation (Horn, H. S., 1968. The adaptive significance of colonial nesting in the Brewer's blackbird (euphagus cyanocephalus). Ecology 49, 682-646). Our modified PS game model shows the same prediction as the Horn's graphical animal aggregation model; the proportion of scroungers will increase or animals should adopt colonial foraging when resource is spatiotemporally clumped, but scroungers will decrease or animals should adopt territorial foraging if there source is evenly distributed.

(kmathot@orn.mpg.de) ; Giraldeau, Luc-Alain				Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology		2010	NOV 2010	64	11	1805-1811	1805	1811	English						0	15	When animals forage in groups, they can search for food themselves (producer tactic), or they can search for opportunities to exploit the food discoveries of others (scrounger tactic). Both theoretical and empirical work have shown that group-level use of these alternative tactics is influenced by environmental conditions including group size and food distribution, and individual tactic use can be influenced by several measures of individual state, including body condition. Because body condition has been shown to be heritable for various species, social foraging tactics may also be heritable. We looked for evidence of heritability in social foraging tactic use in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) by testing whether: (1) natural variation in body condition correlates with tactic use, (2) there are family-related differences in body condition, and (3) there are family-related differences in observed tactic use. Tactic use in the zebra finch was significantly related to body condition; individuals with lower body condition scores had a significantly higher use of the scrounger tactic as predicted from variance-sensitive producer-scrounger models. Body-condition scores differed significantly between families, suggesting that this aspect of individual state may have a heritable component. Finally, we recorded significant family-related differences in the use of producer and scrounger alternatives. These results are consistent with heritability in observed tactic use resulting from an inheritance of individual state, in this case body condition, which itself influences tactic use. Understanding how and why individuals differ in their use of alternative tactics is fundamental as it may provide important insights into inter-individual variation in fitness.

We used two groups, each of seven male birds, labelled 'fast' and 'slow' explorers based on previous studies in which consistent individual differences in the speed of exploring were found. The birds were trained to search for food hidden in a number of differently coloured and shaped feeders, and later to search in only one type of feeder. During the tests, food was absent and the birds were observed in two different situations: alone or in the presence of a tutor, a bird that had been trained to feed in a different kind of feeder. When alone, slow birds readily extended their search to other feeders while fast birds did not change their routine of visiting the previously rewarded ones. In the presence of the tutor, the opposite occurred: slow birds did not change their behaviour while fast birds significantly increased their visits to the feeders indicated by the tutor. Fast and slow individuals thus differ in their foraging and copying behaviour, consistent with the producer-scrounger model.

We investigated the role of kinship and social affiliation on these strategies by combining microsatellite DNA-based measures of relatedness with focal animal behavioral sampling of northwestern crows in the field. Scrounges were either passive (quiet ground approach without pursuit) or aggressive (noisy approach with pursuit). The combination of individually marked animals and information on relatedness allowed investigation of the roles of dominance and kinship in scrounging, including the target and form of the scrounge. Crows in foraging groups were more likely to be associated (i.e., socially affiliated) than were birds in the background population, but were not more likely to be genetically related than were birds in the background population. There was no difference between the average association of the foraging group and the average association between the scrounge interactors. There was also no difference in the average association between passive and aggressive scrounge interactions. Adults were more likely than juveniles to demonstrate a preference for social companions, and males were more likely than females to demonstrate a preference for social companions. Within foraging groups, passive scrounges tended to occur between more closely related individuals, and aggressive scrounges among less closely related individuals. Thus, scroungers modulate their mode of scrounging according to relatedness, or producers modulate their response, or both. They discriminate close from more distant relatives or unrelated individuals by adjusting the level of aggressiveness associated with theft.

Recent theory on behavioural plasticity in games predicts that individuals should differ in their plasticity or responsiveness and hence in their degree of behavioural adjustment. Moreover, individuals are predicted to be consistent in their plasticity within and across biological contexts. These predictions have yet to be tested empirically and so we examine the behavioural adjustment of individual nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura punctulata), gregarious ground-feeding passerines, when playing two different social foraging games: producer-scrounger (PS) and patch-choice (PC) games. We found: (i) significant individual differences in plasticity and sampling behaviour in each of the two games, (ii) individual differences in sampling behaviour were consistent over different test conditions within a game (PC) and over a six month period (PS), (iii) but neither individual plasticity nor sampling behaviour was correlated from one social foraging game to another. The rate at which birds sampled alternative tactics was positively associated with seed intake in PS trials but negatively associated in PC trials. These results suggest that games with frequency dependence of pay-offs can maintain differences in behavioural plasticity but that an important component of this plasticity is group-and/or context-specific.

In behavioral games, what constitutes a good or bad decision about which alternative to use depends on the behavior of other individuals. Solutions to games can take the form of a stable equilibrium frequency (SEF) of alternative tactics. In this study, we ask whether individuals within flocks of ground-feeding passerines (Lonchura punctulata) engaged in a producer-scrounger game adjust their behavior and converge on the SEF by using a fixed rule of thumb or by learning to estimate payoffs by the process of responding to contingencies in reinforcements obtained from each alternative tactic. After being trained either in a high-scrounging (HS) or a low-scrounging (LS) food condition, flocks of birds were provided with identical foraging conditions over 2 successive test phases in which we expected the SEF of scrounging to decrease and then to increase. Birds trained in the HS condition scrounged more than those trained in the LS condition and continued to do so even when subsequently tested in the same conditions. This effect of past experience is inconsistent with the use of a fixed rule alone. An improvement in the efficiency of scrounging behavior within experimental phases provided further evidence of learning in this game-theoretic context. This experiment provides the first empirical evidence that group-level adjustments in scrounger use to different environmental conditions are mediated by learning the payoffs associated with each tactic.

Theoretical Population Biology		2014	FEB 2014	91		50-57	50	57	English						1	37	Social learning mechanisms are widely thought to vary in their degree of complexity as well as in their prevalence in the natural world. While learning the properties of a stimulus that generalize to similar stimuli at other locations (stimulus enhancement) prima fade appears more useful to an animal than learning about a specific stimulus at a specific location (local enhancement), empirical evidence suggests that the latter is much more widespread in nature. Simulating populations engaged in a producer scrounger game, we sought to deploy mathematical models to identify the adaptive benefits of reliance on local enhancement and/or stimulus enhancement, and the alternative conditions favoring their evolution. Surprisingly, we found that while stimulus enhancement readily evolves, local enhancement is advantageous only under highly restricted conditions: when generalization of information was made unreliable or when error in social learning was high. Our results generate a conundrum over how seemingly conflicting empirical and theoretical findings can be reconciled. Perhaps the prevalence of local enhancement in nature is due to stimulus enhancement costs independent of the learning task itself (e.g. predation risk), perhaps natural habitats are often characterized by unreliable yet highly rewarding payoffs, or perhaps local enhancement occurs less frequently, and stimulus enhancement more frequently, than widely believed.

Individuals can either search for food sources themselves (producing) or they can join food discoveries of others (scrounging). In this study we use a genetic algorithm in a spatially explicit producer-scrounger game to explore how individuals compromise between exploration (an important axis of animal personality) and scrounging and how characteristics of the environment affect this compromise. Agents varied in exploration and scrounging and a genetic algorithm searched for the optimal combination of exploration and scrounging. The foraging environments featured different levels of patch richness, predation and patch density. Our simulations show that under conditions of low patch densities slow exploring scroungers were favored whereas high patch density favored fast exploring individuals that either produced (at low patch richness) or scrounged (at high patch richness). In high predation environments fast exploring individuals were selected for but only at low to intermediate patch densities. Predation did not affect scrounging behavior. We did not find a divergence of exploration 'types' within a given environment, but there was a general association between exploration and scrounging across different environments: high rates of scrounging were observed over nearly the full spectrum of exploration values, whereas high rates of producing were only observed at high exploration values, suggesting that cases in which slow explorers start producing should be rare. Our results indicate that the spatial arrangement of food resources can affect the optimal social attraction rules between agents, the optimality of foraging tactic and the interaction between both.

In one experiment, three different patch types were tested on the whole flock while, in a second, flock composition was varied for one patch type. In all cases we found non-uniform distributions of the number of patches produced per individual, which suggests the existence of producer and scrounger roles. This result could not be explained by either dominance or variability in individual learning ability. Individuals switched roles in response to changes both in food patch type and flock composition. These results are discussed in light of the skill pool hypothesis, which suggests that, in a group, different foraging specialists will profit by parasitizing each other's food discoveries.

Animal Behaviour		1998	March, 1998	55	3	737-744	737	744	English	print					0	14	In social foraging, scroungers take a disproportionately large share of the food found relative to their own food-searching efforts, while producers find more food than they manage to monopolize. We present a model of social foraging acknowledging the finder's advantage and foraging role asymmetries among individuals but incorporating the possibility that producers and scroungers differ in vigilance level and in vulnerability to predators. This allows simultaneous examination of both foraging benefits and anti-predatory aspects of grouping behaviour. Instead of seeking for equal payoff conditions, we first look for groups in which foraging character combinations and anti-predatory properties of producers and scroungers minimize the phenotype-specific predation hazard over food-intake rate, Ri/Ii, that is, fixed phenotype Ri/Ii minima. In the second approach, we allow individuals to change their foraging status to achieve lower Ri/Ii and look for combinations where it no longer pays for either producers or scroungers to change their roles, that is, evolutionarily stable group compositions, ESS. Various character combinations allow the phenotype-specific minima. In most cases, however, producers' and scroungers' minima are achievable only in different group compositions. The ESS combinations of producers and scroungers deviate widely from those combinations yielding phenotype-specific minima of Ri/Ii. If individuals are allowed to be flexible in adopting either a producer or a scrounger role, ESS group compositions will emerge, even though they are more expensive for both producers and scroungers in terms of Ri/Ii than group compositions yielding the phenotype-specific Ri/Ii minima.

Owing to the intrinsic stochastic and frequency-dependent nature of learning dynamics, these rules are often studied in evolutionary biology via agent-based computer simulations. In this paper, we show that stochastic approximation theory can help to qualitatively understand learning dynamics and formulate analytical models for the evolution of learning rules. We consider a population of individuals repeatedly interacting during their lifespan, and where the stage game faced by the individuals fluctuates according to an environmental stochastic process. Individuals adjust their behavioral actions according to learning rules belonging to the class of experience-weighted attraction learning mechanisms, which includes standard reinforcement and Bayesian learning as special cases. We use stochastic approximation theory in order to derive differential equations governing action play probabilities, which turn out to have qualitative features of mutator-selection equations. We then perform agent-based simulations to find the conditions where the deterministic approximation is closest to the original stochastic learning process for standard 2-action 2-player fluctuating games, where interaction between learning rules and preference reversal may occur. Finally, we analyze a simplified model for the evolution of learning in a producer-scrounger game, which shows that the exploration rate can interact in a non-intuitive way with other features of co-evolving learning rules. Overall, our analyses illustrate the usefulness of applying stochastic approximation theory in the study of animal learning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The scrounger tactic may provide greater antipredator benefits than the producer tactic because "scroungers" hop with their heads up and tend to occupy central positions in a group, whereas "producers" hop with their heads down and tend to occupy edge positions. We tested whether increasing an individual's vulnerability to predation (using wing-loading manipulations) causes an increased preference for the scrounger tactic in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Wing-loading manipulations were effective at increasing focal individuals' perception of vulnerability to predation; treatment individuals increased their total time allocated to vigilance, whereas control individuals did not. Treatment individuals also increased their use of the scrounger tactic (proportion of hops with head up) and scrounged a greater proportion of patches, whereas control individuals exhibited no changes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the scrounger tactic confers greater antipredator benefits than the producer tactic, although whether antipredator benefits are achieved through differences in head orientation, spatial position, or both, remains unclear. Our finding that individuals adjust their use of the scrounger tactic according to changes in their phenotype provides evidence for phenotype-limited allocation strategies in producer-scrounger games.

Game theory applied to kleptoparasitic populations with food sharing		Hadjichrysanthou, Christoforos (christoforos.hadjichrysanthou.1@city.ac.uk) ; Broom, Mark				Behavioral Ecology		2012	SEP-OCT 2012	23	5	977-991	977	991	English						1	48	Animals adopt varied foraging tactics in order to survive. Kleptoparasitism, where animals attempt to steal food already discovered by others, is very common among animal species. In this situation, depending on the ecological conditions, challenged animals might defend, share, or even retreat and leave their food to the challenger. A key determinant of the likely behavior is the nature of the food itself. If food is discovered in divisible clumps, it can be divided between animals in a number of ways. This is the general assumption in one type of game-theoretical model of food stealing, producer-scrounger models. Alternatively, food items may be essentially indivisible, so that sharing is impossible and either the attacker or the defender must retain control of all of the food. This is the assumption of the alternative game-theoretical models of kleptoparasitism. In this paper, using a game-theoretic approach, we relax this assumption of indivisibility and introduce the possibility of limited food sharing behavior between animals in kleptoparasitic populations. Considering the conditions under which food sharing is likely to be common, it is shown that food sharing should occur in a wide range of ecological conditions. In particular, if food availability is limited, the sharing process does not greatly reduce the short-term consumption rate of food and food defense has a high cost and/or a low probability of success, then the use of the food sharing strategy is beneficial. Thus, the assumption of the indivisibility of food items is an important component of previous models.

However, all pairs of strategies can coexist. Three parameters control the proportions of coexisting strategists: the degree of compatibility between the opportunist's producing and scrounging activities; the proportion of food patches that are shared with scrounging individuals; and the effective group size. When there is little incompatibility between producing and scrounging, opportunists will always be present, unless the producer is able to consume most of the patch without sharing. The opportunist strategy is always excluded when there is a high degree of incompatibility between producing and scrounging. We consider the organismal and ecological factors that are likely to affect all three parameters. Our model predicts that scrounging behavior is likely to be selected in a wide range of foraging groups and that it may impose a considerable cost sociality.

In behavioral ecology, the prevalence of free riders can be predicted by a well-known game-theoretical model-the producer-scrounger (PS) model-where group members have the options to either search for resources (producers) or exploit the efforts of others (scroungers). The PS model has received some empirical support, but its predictions, surprisingly, are based on the strict assumption that only one resource can be exploited at a time. Yet, multiple simultaneous opportunities to exploit others' efforts should frequently occur in nature. Here, we combine analytic and simulation approaches to explore the effect of multiple simultaneous scrounging opportunities on tactic use. Our analyses demonstrate that scrounging rates should increase with the number of simultaneous opportunities. As such, the amount and spatial distribution (i.e., clumped vs. dispersed) of resources as well as the risk of predation are key predictors of scrounging behavior. Because scroungers contribute to reducing the speed of resource exploitation, the model proposed here has direct relevance to the exploitation and sustainability of renewable resources.

Information-sharing (IS) and producer-scrounger (PS) games predict different joining frequencies because they make distinct assumptions about food searching. IS games assume individuals can search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while PS games assume incompatible search modes; individuals search either as a producer, detecting only finding opportunities, or as a scrounger, detecting only joining opportunities. To determine the search assumption for flocks of ground-feeding granivores we studied the behaviour of spice finches, Lonchura punctulata, foraging in indoor aviaries for clumps of hidden millet seed. We looked for behaviour patterns preceding finding and joining events. An analysis of covariance showed that the frequencies of hopping with the head pointing up and down were statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the seed distribution, the birds' relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly. When the seed distribution made any use of the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the head up declined to zero. Consequently, in ground-feeding birds such as spice finches, finding and joining behaviour conform more closely to the assumptions of a PS rather than an IS game.

Both tactics yield equal rewards on average, but the rewards generated by producer are more variable. A dynamic variance-sensitive foraging model predicts that social foragers should increase their use of scrounger with increasing energy requirements and/or decreased food availability early in the foraging period. We tested whether natural variation in minimum energy requirements (basal metabolic rate or BMR) is associated with differences in the use of producer-scrounger foraging tactics in female zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata. As predicted by the dynamic variance-sensitive model, high BMR individuals had significantly greater use of the scrounger tactic compared with low BMR individuals. However, we observed no effect of food availability on tactic use, indicating that female zebra finches were not variance-sensitive foragers under our experimental conditions. This study is the first to report that variation in BMR within a species is associated with differences in foraging behaviour. BMR-related differences in scrounger tactic use are consistent with phenotype-dependent tactic use decisions. We suggest that BMR is correlated with another phenotypic trait which itself influences tactic use decisions.

Animal Behaviour		2001	July, 2001	62	1	47-56	47	56	English	print					6	53	Group living can confer advantages to individuals, but it can also impose severe costs through resource competition. Kleptoparasitism is one example in which some individuals (joiners) can exploit the food discovered by other animals (finders). This type of social foraging has been modelled either as an information-sharing model or as a producer-scrounger game. An important variable in these models is the finder's advantage: the number of items obtained by the finder before the arrival of other individuals. In this study we describe how the spatial position and rank of individuals in a group of wild tufted capuchin monkeys affect their ability to discover and exploit new food sources. We also analyse the factors that affect the finder's share and the total amount of food obtained by the finder from a newly discovered resource. By placing platforms filled with bananas at novel locations in their home range, we show that animals in the leading edge of a foraging group have a higher probability of discovering new food sources than animals occupying other spatial positions. The alpha male and the alpha female, which tended to occupy central-forward positions, were able to monopolize newly discovered food sources and thus obtain a major share of them. The finder's share at the feeding platforms was smaller when there was more food on a platform, but increased with longer delays before the arrival of other individuals. The total amount of food obtained by the finder from the feeding platforms was larger when there was more food on the platform, when the finder was of higher social status, and when it took longer for other individuals to arrive. Animals can increase their finder's share and total amount consumed from a newly discovered resource by keeping large interindividual distances and by avoiding giving cues about the presence of food (such as food-associated vocalizations) to other animals.

This resource can be food or a territory, and in some situations, potentially divisible. In a previous paper we considered a producer and scrounger competing for an indivisible resource, where each individual could choose the level of energy that they would invest in the contest. The higher the investment, the higher the probability of success, but also the higher the costs incurred in the contest. In that paper decisions were sequential with the scrounger choosing their strategy before the producer. In this paper we consider a version of the game where decisions are made simultaneously. For the same cost functions as before, we analyse this case in detail, and then make comparisons between the two cases. Finally we discuss some real examples with potentially variable and asymmetric energetic investments, including intraspecific contests amongst spiders and amongst parasitoid wasps. In the case of the spiders, detailed estimates of energetic expenditure are available which demonstrate the asymmetric values assumed in our models. For the wasps the value of the resource can affect the probabilities of success of the defender and attacker, and differential energetic investment can be inferred. In general for real populations energy usage varies markedly depending upon crucial parameters extrinsic to the individual such as resource value and intrinsic ones such as age, and is thus an important factor to consider when modelling.

Group-foraging nutmeg mannikins engaged in a producer-scrounger game search for their own food (play producer) by hopping with the head down and search for others' food discoveries (play scrounger) by hopping with the head up. If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence to more joining by foragers. We tested this prediction as well as the extent to which stationary birds use head up exclusively for antipredatory purposes and hopping birds use head up for foraging purposes only. We observed three flocks of nutmeg mannikins searching for hidden clumps of food in an indoor aviary. We used a 2X2 factorial design in which both the distance to a safe refuge and the food distribution were manipulated. The use of head up by stationary and eating birds increased significantly with increased distance to cover. Distance to cover, however, had no effect on the use of the scrounger tactic or on the level of joining. We found no evidence of compatibility between the scrounger tactic and antipredatory vigilance. Our results provide the first unambiguous evidence for the existence of two distinct and incompatible patterns of vigilance for predators and for conspecifics.

Risk of predation, time spent engaging in antipredatory behavior, and feeding competition ran all vary with respect to spatial position. Previous research has found evidence that feeding rates art? higher (it the group edge in many species, but these studies have not represented the entire breadth of dietary diversity and ecological situations faced by many animals. In parlicularly, the presence of concentrated, defendable food patches can lead to increased feeding rates by dominants in the center of the group that are able to monopolize or defend these areas. To fully understand the tradeoffs of within-group spatial position in relation to a variety of factors, it is important to be able to predict where individuals should preferable, position themselves in relation to feeding rates and food competition. A qualitative model is presented here to Predict how food depletion time, abundance of food patches within a group, and the presence of prior knowledge of feeding sites affect the payoffs of different within group spatial positions for dominant and subordinate animals. In general, when feeding on small abundant food items, individuals (it the front edge of the group should have higher foraging success. When feeding oil slowly depleted, rare food items, dominants will often have the highest feeding rates in the center of the group).

(guy.beauchamp@umontreal.ca)				Ethology		2006	SEP 2006	112	9	873-878	873	878	English						2	30	In flocks, individuals can search for their own food using the producer tactic or exploit the discoveries of companions using the scrounger tactic. Models of the producer-scrounger game usually assume that tactic payoffs are independent of individual phenotypic traits. However, factors such as dominance status or foraging efficiency may constrain the use of tactics and lead to asymmetric tactic use among individuals. For instance, in flocks composed of foragers with unequal foraging efficiency, foragers that are less efficient at obtaining food are expected to rely on the scrounger tactic to a greater extent. I examined the role of foraging efficiency and dominance status as potential correlates of scrounging behavior in small aviary flocks of zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata). Individual foraging efficiency was documented in each flock in a treatment that prevented scrounging. In a subsequent treatment that allowed scrounging, higher levels of scrounging occurred as predicted in foragers with lower foraging efficiency. Dominance status was a poor predictor of tactic choice. Birds that arrived later on the foraging grid foraged less efficiently when scrounging was prevented and used scrounging to a greater extent when allowed, suggesting a link between boldness, foraging efficiency and the choice of foraging tactics in small flocks of zebra finches.

Animal Behaviour		1996		51	1	171-175	171	175	English						0	10	The producer-scrounger model of Barnard and Sibly (1981, Anim. Behav., 29, 543-550) predicts that at a certain ratio of producers and scroungers in a foraging group the payoff curves for individuals of the two phenotypes intercept. At this point all the group members obtain equal payoffs. In this paper, the original model is elaborated further by allowing individuals to differ not only in their food-finding abilities but also in their abilities to compete for the food once it is found. As in Barnard and Sibly's original model foraging individuals are assumed to share information about the whereabouts of food patches and to benefit from patches found by others. Here it is determined under which combinations of searching and sharing characters food intake rate in mixed-phenotype groups would be equal for producing and scrounging individuals. In the present model the payoffs are much affected by both the finder's advantage (the fraction of prey available only to the finder of the food-patch) and the combination of the foraging characters of the two phenotypes. Generally the intake rate of producers increases with their presence in the group and with increases in the finder's advantage. Our model suggests that the equal payoffs arise only when the relative food-searching and competitive abilities of producers and scroungers fall within a narrow range of options acknowledging also the finder's advantage. Moreover, such combinations are predicted to be unstable if only foraging benefits are called for in group formation, this being a common feature of social foraging models incorporating foraging role asymmetries.

There is no convincing evidence that robbers obtained other benefits, such as access to a good feeding site, besides the stolen prey itself. The data are consistent with the view that kleptoparasitism should be treated as a problem of prey choice, where attacks are initiated so as to maximize the net rate of energy gain. Attacks were directed mainly towards conspecifics handlings large prey animals. There was no evidence of a simple producer-scrounger dichotomy. Instead, a dominance hierarchy seems more likely, where each individual could initiate attacks, but did so predominantly towards subdominant individuals, according to immediate profitability.

Here we consider how social interactions can create unique, evolving patterns in space and time. Whereas simple prey taxis (with consumable prey) promotes spatial uniform distributions, here we show that taxis in producer-scrounger groups can lead to pattern formation. We consider two types of foragers: those that search directly ("producers") and those that exploit other foragers to find food ("scroungers" or exploiters). We show that such groups can sustain fluctuating spatiotemporal patterns, akin to "waves of pursuit." Investigating the relative benefits to the individuals, we observed conditions under which either strategy leads to enhanced success, defined as net food consumption. Foragers that search for food directly have an advantage when food patches are localized. Those that seek aggregations of group mates do better when their ability to track group mates exceeds the foragers' food-sensing acuity. When behavioral switching or reproductive success of the strategies is included, the relative abundance of foragers and exploiters is dynamic over time, in contrast with classic models that predict stable frequencies. Our work shows the importance of considering two-way interaction-i.e., how food distribution both influences and is influenced by social foraging and aggregation of predators.

G., Firth, J. A., Davidson, G. L., Crofts, S. J., & Quinn, J. L. (2021) Cognition and covariance in the producer-scrounger game. Journal of Animal Ecology, . When foraging in groups, individuals can either acquire their own resources, as producers, or profit from the work of other individuals, as scroungers. Individuals vary in how much they rely on one foraging tactic over the other. Yet, each of these foraging tactics presents unique cognitive challenges. Using a field experiment with a mixed-species flock of birds, Reichert et al. (2021) investigated how production learning (i.e. successfully feeding from their assigned rewarded feeder) and scrounging propensity (i.e. collecting food from a non-assigned feeders by following another individual) are related at an individual level, as well as the repeatability of both production learning and scrounging propensity. The authors show that overall, (a) individuals learned to scrounge, (b) individuals who rely more on scrounging took longer to learn their assigned feeder and (c) variation in each cognitive trait was mostly explained by individual behavioural flexibility rather than by consistent differences between individuals. Since learning was negatively correlated with the use of an alternative foraging tactic (i.e. scrounging), results of this study also suggest that individual choice of foraging tactics should be considered when evaluating cognitive abilities in wild animals.

Producer-scrounger ( PS) models predict that at equilibrium scrounging will increase with group size and with patch richness but will be independent of food patch encounter rate. Earlier PS models assume that foragers arrive instantaneously at scrounged food patches, which is not realistic at the habitat level, at which food patches can be far apart. Here, I develop a spatially explicit model of producing and scrounging in which individuals pay a time cost when travelling to scrounged food patches and may join patches with little or no food left when they arrive. Using a genetic-algorithm approach, I confirm that scrounging increases with patch richness and add several novel predictions. In particular, scrounging is expected to increase with a decrease in food patch encounter rate and can actually decrease when forager density is high. In habitats in which food intake rate increases with the number of foragers at food patches, scrounging at low forager densities is actually predicted to increase success. The spatial model also highlights the self-organizing nature of scrounging. Because scrounging reduces the average distance between foragers, thus reducing the costs of joining, attempts to scrounge make further scrounging more likely to evolve. The spatial model of producing and scrounging provides novel insights into the evolution of group foraging. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although real ecological communities contain many gregarious species, whose foraging behaviour should be influenced by socially transmitted information, few theoretical studies have examined the possibility that social foraging might resolve this paradox. I considered a predator population in which individuals play the producer-scrounger foraging game in one-prey-one-predator and two-prey-onepredator systems. I analysed the stability of a coexisting equilibrium point in the one-prey system and that of nonequilibrium dynamics in the two-prey system. The results revealed that social foraging could stabilize both systems, and thereby resolve the paradox of enrichment when scrounging behaviour (i.e. kleptoparasitism) is prevalent in predators. This suggests a previously neglected mechanism underlying a powerful effect of group-living animals on the sustainability of ecological communities.

We develop a model to demonstrate how competition can facilitate or constrain an individual's ability to use information when acquiring resources. As resource distribution underpins both selection on information use and the strength and nature of competition between individuals, we demonstrate interdependencies between the two that should be common in nature. Individuals in our model can search for resources either personally or by using social information. We explore selection on social information use across a comprehensive range of ecological conditions, generalizing the producer scrounger framework to a wide diversity of taxa and resources. We show that resource ecology defined by scarcity, depletion rate and monopolizability determines patterns of individual differences in social information use. These differences suggest coevolutionary processes linking dominance systems and social information use, with implications for the evolutionary demography of populations.	Lee, Alexander E.

This might impair the results and lead to misinterpretation about the learning abilities of the targeted species. In order to provide an alternative to the individual-based tests, we investigated for the first time the operant conditioning of four similar groups (50 individuals per tank) of sea bass. We used two computerized self-feeder devices per tank, each coupled with individual electronic identification and that were alternately activated during varying positive appetitive reinforcement period of time (7 to 1 day). Learning abilities were examined at both group and individual levels. At the group level, the operant conditioning was demonstrated as the triggering activity significantly decreased when the device was turned off and increased when it was turned on, whatever the reinforcement period duration. The individual level analysis revealed a more complex situation with fish showing different learning performances that can be best explained through the producer-scrounger game theory.

J	BACD199799784332		Article		Influence of conspecific attraction on the spatial distribution of learning foragers in a patchy habitat		Beauchamp, G.; Belisle, M.; Giraldeau, L.-A.				Journal of Animal Ecology		1997		66	5	671-682	671	682	English						1	29	1. Individuals in many social species are attracted to feeding conspecifics. The profitability of conspecific attraction is negatively frequency-dependent and can be modelled as a producer-scrounger (PS) game for which the ESS solution predicts some mixture of producer (no attraction) and scrounger (attraction) tactics in the population. Current models for the spatial distribution of rate-maximizing foragers, which learn the quality of habitats as they exploit patches, ignore the possible effect of conspecific attraction on the stable distribution of foragers. 2. We used simulations of a population with ESS levels of attraction to investigate the effect of conspecific attraction on the spatial distribution of learning foragers which incur travel costs. In habitats where patches depleted slowly, ESS levels of attraction helped foragers which experienced no interference reach the expected ideal free distribution (IFD) by facilitating aggregation to the richest patches. Large aggregations also occurred with interference and thus reduced the fit to the IFD, which in this case predicts a scatter of foragers across patches of varying quality. 3. In habitats where patches depleted rapidly, ESS levels of attraction prevented foragers from reaching the IFD, irrespective of interference levels. Foragers failed to learn habitat quality and thus often aggregated in poor patches, especially in large populations which depleted patches faster and had fewer opportunities to learn quality. 4. Predictions of the model in habitats where patches deplete slowly are supported by several studies. More work is needed for habitats where patches deplete more rapidly. We conclude that conspecific attraction can have important, and often disruptive effects on spatial distributions.	Giraldeau, L.-A.; Dep.

Much recent work has concentrated on behavioral variation within animal populations along the bold/shy continuum. Here, we screened individual guppies, Poecilia reticulata, for boldness using an overhead fright stimulus. We created groups consisting of 4 bold individuals (bold shoals), 4 shy individuals (shy shoals), or 2 bold and 2 shy individuals (mixed shoals). The performance of these different shoal types was then tested in a novel foraging scenario. We found that both bold and mixed shoals approached a novel feeder in less time than shy shoals. Interestingly, we found that more fish from mixed shoals fed than in either bold or shy shoals. We suggest that this can be explained by the fact that nearly all the cases where one fish was followed into the feeder by another occurred within mixed shoals and that it was almost always a shy fish following a bold one. These results suggest clear foraging benefits to shy individuals through associating with bold ones. Surprisingly, our results also suggest potential foraging benefits to bold individuals through associating with shy individuals. This study highlights a possible mechanism by which interindividual variation in behavioral types is maintained in a population.	Dyer, John R.

One way this can happen is when individuals engage in activities with two behavioural options and learn which option to choose. We analyse interactions in groups where individuals learn from playing games with two actions and negatively frequency-dependent payoffs, such as producer-scrounger, caller-satellite, or hawk-dove games. Group members are placed in social networks, characterized by the group size and the number of neighbours to interact with, ranging from just a few neighbours to interactions between all group members. The networks we analyse include ring lattices and the much-studied small-world networks. By implementing two basic reinforcement-learning approaches, action-value learning and actor-critic learning, in different games, we find that individuals often show behavioural specialization. Specialization develops more rapidly when there are few neighbours in a network and when learning rates are high. There can be learned specialization also with many neighbours, but we show that, for action-value learning, behavioural consistency over time is higher with a smaller number of neighbours. We conclude that frequency-dependent competition for resources is a main driver of specialization. We discuss our theoretical results in relation to experimental and field observations of behavioural specialization in social situations.

Its evolution has typically been attributed to the resulting increased prey capture rate. Indeed, many studies have documented positive correlations between the number of individuals and probability of success, suggesting that joint hunting is cooperative. However, all existing data on vertebrates are based on field observations and hence cannot control for factors that may also influence hunting success, such as variation in habitat structure, hunting motivation or prey state. Therefore, we conducted controlled laboratory experiments to test whether hunting performance is affected by group size in the grouphunting yellow saddle goatfish. We presented invertebrate prey in an artificial coral reef and measured hunting performance as a function of manipulated group size, ranging from one to four individuals. We found that individuals hunting alone failed to catch the prey within the trial time limit significantly more often than groups did. Furthermore, we found that time until capture depended on group size, with singletons being slowest and groups of four fastest. With few exceptions, group members were approximately equally likely to catch prey. Hunting success as a singleton did not predict an individual's prey capture probability when in a group, suggesting that group hunting involves some producer-scrounger dynamics. In conclusion, while the experiment cannot address the question of how group size affects individual net calorie intake, the results show that groups are more successful at hunting than singletons are.

Within a given species, individuals might differ in their propensity to use such a tactic, in a similar manner to which they differ in their general level of aggressiveness. Standard metabolic rate is often viewed as a proxy for energy requirements. For this reason, it should directly impact on both kleptoparasitism and aggressiveness when individuals have to share the same food source. In the present study we first assessed the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of 128 juvenile European eels (Anguilla anguilla) by the determination of oxygen consumption. We then tested how the SMR could influence agonistic behavior of individuals competing for food in three distinct trials evenly distributed over three months. We demonstrate that SMR positively correlates with attacks (sum of bite and push events) in all trials. Similarly SMR correlated positively with kleptoparasitism (food theft), but this was significant only for the third trial (month 3). To our knowledge, the present study is the first reporting a link between kleptoparasitism and SMR in a fish species. This has ecological implications owing to the fact that this species is characterized by an environmental sex determination linked to early growth rate. We discuss theses findings in the light of the producer-scrounger foraging game. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In a captive flock of house sparrows, we observed the behaviour of the birds when they were foraging on a grid containing clumps of seeds. We measured the fighting success of the birds, determined the method by which they found food clumps (finding or joining), and measured their feeding rate. Joining were frequently observed and usually involved aggressive interactions. Most birds used both finding and joining to obtain food. We found that foraging method was related to dominance: the frequency of joining gradually increased with increasing dominance rank, as predicted by the phenotype limited model for flocks where there are moderate competitive asymmetries among the birds. Food intake rate of individuals was not related to either their dominance rank or foraging method. Similar weak relationships were predicted by the model among these variables for flocks with moderate competitive asymmetries. Behavioural variability among sparrows in locomotion frequency and vigilance was not related to their foraging method, but the rate of investigating potential food caches strongly decreased with increasing frequency of joining. We conclude that the phenotype limited model successfully predicts the relationship between dominance and joining frequency in house sparrows feeding on concentrated food sources, and we suggest that the distribution of food used in tests of the model may crucially affect their results.

(narj@st-andrews.ac.uk) ; Webster, Mike; Templeton, Christopher N.; Schuster, Stefan; Rendell, Luke				Animal Behaviour		2018	JUL 2018	141		95-103	95	103	English						1	15	The social environment can play an important role in shaping the foraging behaviour of animals. In this study we investigated whether archerfish, Toxotes jaculatrix, display any behavioural changes in response to the presence of an audience while using their specialized foraging tactic of shooting, spitting precisely aimed jets of water, at prey targets. As any prey items shot down are potentially available to competitors, we hypothesized that shooting fish would be sensitive to the presence of potential competitors, especially given the suggestion that, in the wild, this species shows intraspecific kleptoparasitism and faces interspecific competition. We found that in the presence of another fish, archerfish took longer to shoot, made more orientations (aiming events) per shot, and tended to be closer to the target at the time of shooting. Additionally, archerfish showed high interindividual differences in latency to shoot, and these differences were consistent across contexts, with and without an audience. Our results show that archerfish are sensitive to, and adjust their shooting behaviour in response to, the presence of an audience and highlight the importance of social context in this fish species. We also suggest that interindividual differences may play an important role in archerfish shooting behaviour. This study highlights the importance of social effects and competition on foraging behaviour and decision making. Further work in this species could explore whether differences in competitive foraging ability are linked to sensitivity to the presence of an audience.

Such individual differences are correlated with personality traits, suggesting that personality could directly affect individuals' ability to collect personal or social information. Alternatively, the link between personality and information use could simply emerge as a by-product of the sequential decision-making process in a frequency-dependent context. Indeed, when the gains associated with behavioural options depend on the choices of others, an individual's sequence of arrival could constrain its choice of options leading to the emergence of correlated behaviours. Any factor such as personality that affects decision order could thus be correlated with information use. To test this new explanation, we developed an individual-based model that simulates a group of animals engaged in a game of sequential frequency-dependent decision: a producer-scrounger game. Our results confirm that the sequence of decision, in this case enforced by the order in which animals enter a foraging area, consistently influences their mean tactic use and their individual plasticity, an outcome reminiscent of the correlation reported between personality and social information use.

SI	477-484	477	484	English						0	17	The efficiency in which high-density food patches are found is determined by the way foragers move between patches. In this study we explore the effect of social interactions on the foraging path, in particular the distance moved between patches. We studied Bewick's Swans Cygnus columbianus bewicku that foraged on belowground tubers of Fennel Pondweed Potamogeton pectinatus. We accurately mapped the foraging path of individual swans and determined the distances between visited patches. 24% of inter-patch movements are associated with social interactions. When a swan retreats from a patch because it is chased away by another swan, it moves a significantly larger distance to a patch than if the movement is not associated with a social interaction. Such longer movements are thought to reduce the rate at which high-density patches are encountered, and thus the energy gain rate a swan can achieve. We observed a strong social hierarchy in which families are dominant over pairs and singletons, and pairs are dominant over singletons, which represents a producer-scrounger model. Singletons were most frequently observed to retreat from patches and are consequently thought to achieve the lowest gain rates. However singletons might partly compensate for more frequent retreats from patches by moving larger distances to arrive at the front edge of a flock where they encounter unexploited resources.

However, the effects of resource depletion have rarely been discussed in the context of sexual selection, even though mate choice typically favours males who outperform others in securing access to some limited resource. Here, we develop a model to investigate the question of resource competition as a form of male-male competition in the context of male sexual displays. We phrase our model in terms of male bowerbirds either searching for or stealing resources (ornamental objects) valued by females, and compare the model findings with published studies of time allocation to various activities in different species of bowerbirds. The basic idea of the model, however, extends to cases where the resource is used less directly for the development of sexual ornamentation, such as males excluding others' access to food. We show that if males compete for resources used in sexual displays, intense female preference for high-quality displays can lead to poorer prospects for efficient choice by females. This is because males benefit from excluding others' access to resources used in displays, damaging the overall efficiency of resource use in the population, and the accuracy with which females can judge male ability to gain such resources. The evolution of female choice may therefore have a self-limiting nature when it poses a selection pressure on male resource acquisition.

Punishing individuals who contribute little provides a potential answer but changes the dilemma to why pay the costs of punishing which, like cooperation itself, provides a public good. Nevertheless, people are observed to punish others in behavioural economic games, posing a problem for existing theory which highlights the difficulty in explaining the spread and persistence of punishment. Here, I consider the apparent mismatch between theory and evidence and show by means of instructive analysis and simulation how much of the experimental evidence for punishment comes from scenarios in which punishers may expect to obtain a net benefit from punishing free-riders. In repeated games within groups, punishment works by imposing costs on defectors so that it pays them to switch to cooperating. Both punishers and non-punishers then benefit from the resulting increase in cooperation, hence investing in punishment can constitute a social dilemma. However, I show the conditions in which the benefits of increased cooperation are so great that they more than offset the costs of punishing, thereby removing the temptation to free-ride on others' investments and making punishment explicable in terms of direct self-interest. Crucially, this is because of the leveraging effect imposed in typical studies whereby people can pay a small cost to inflict a heavy loss on a punished individual. In contrast to previous models suggesting punishment is disadvantaged when rare, I show it can invade until it comes into a producer-scrounger equilibrium with non-punishers. I conclude that adding punishment to an iterated public goods game can solve the problem of achieving cooperation by removing the social dilemma.

If, as will commonly be true, the time taken to join another individual on a patch increases with the distance to that patch, then we would expect foragers to be selective in accepting joining opportunities: preferentially joining nearby discoveries. If competition occurs on patches, then the profitability of joining (and of not joining) will be influenced by the strategies adopted by others. Here we present a series of models designed to illuminate the evolutionarily stable joining strategy. We confirm rigorously the previous suggestion that there should be a critical joining distance, with all joining opportunities within that distance being accepted and all others being declined. Further, we predict that this distance should be unaffected by the total availability of food in the environment, but should increase with decreasing density of other foragers, increasing speed of movement towards joining opportunities, increased difficulty in finding undiscovered food patches, and decreasing speed with which discovered patches can be harvested. We are further able to make predictions as to how fully discovered patches should be exploited before being abandoned as unprofitable, with discovered patches being more heavily exploited when patches are hard to find: patches can be searched for remaining food more quickly, forager density is low, and foragers are relatively slow in traveling to discovered patches.

Behavioral Ecology		2012	JAN-FEB 2012	23	1	51-57	51	57	English						1	40	An increasing number of studies report the presence of consistent individual differences in behavior and/or physiology over time and context, known as animal personality. A pivotal question in animal personality research concerns the mechanism(s) responsible for its evolution and maintenance. Negative frequency-dependent selection is considered to be one of these important mechanisms, although evidence for this is largely absent. Here, we studied whether the feeding performance of barnacle geese was negative frequency-dependent in a producer-scrounger game. We studied the feeding time of one bold or one shy individual in groups consisting of only bold or shy companions to study if the rare type in the group performs best. A previous study with this species showed that scrounging increased with shyness. Hence, we expected shy individuals to do better in the presence of bold companions due to the increased scrounging opportunity and bold individuals to do better in the presence of shy companions as there were ample opportunities to produce food. We found no evidence for negative frequency-dependent feeding success; rather, we found that, independent of their boldness score, all individuals enjoyed higher feeding success when foraging with bold than with shy companions. The higher foraging success of individuals foraging with bold companions is explained by a higher joining proportion in the presence of bold companions. Our results provide no evidence for negative frequency-dependent feeding success in barnacle geese but indicate that both bold and shy individuals can increase their foraging returns by associating with bold individuals.

(allee@jyu.fi) ; Cowlishaw, Guy				PeerJ		2017	JUN 30 2017	5		Article No.: e3462	e3462		English						1	18	When foraging in a social group, individuals are faced with the choice of sampling their environment directly or exploiting the discoveries of others. The evolutionary dynamics of this trade-off have been explored mathematically through the producer-scrounger game, which has highlighted socially exploitative behaviours as a major potential cost of group living. However, our understanding of the tight interplay that can exist between social dominance and scrounging behaviour is limited. To date, only two theoretical studies have explored this relationship systematically, demonstrating that because scrounging requires joining a competitor at a resource, it should become exclusive to high-ranking individuals when resources are monopolisable. In this study, we explore the predictions of this model through observations of the natural social foraging behaviour of a wild population of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). We collected data through over 800 h of focal follows of 101 adults and juveniles across two troops over two 3-month periods. By recording over 7,900 social foraging decisions at two spatial scales we show that, when resources are large and economically indefensible, the joining behaviour required for scrounging can occur across all social ranks. When, in contrast, dominant individuals can aggressively appropriate a resource, such joining behaviour becomes increasingly difficult to employ with decreasing social rank because adult individuals can only join others lower ranking than themselves. Our study supports theoretical predictions and highlights potentially important individual constraints on the ability of individuals of low social rank to use social information, driven by competition with dominant conspecifics over monopolisable resources.

Research on the producerscrounger game has focused mainly on the different factors influencing its evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) solution, but very little is known about the actual mechanisms that shape players' decisions. Recent work has shown that early experience can affect producerscrounger foraging tendencies in young house sparrows and that in nutmeg mannikins learning is involved in reaching the ESS. Here, we show that direct manipulation of the success rate experienced by adult sparrows when following others can change their strategy choice on the following day. We presented to live sparrows an experimental regime, where stuffed adult house sparrows in a feeding position were positioned on a foraging grid that included two reward regimes: a positive one, in which the stuffed models were placed near food, and a negative one, in which the models were placed away from food. There was a significant increase in joining behavior after the positive treatment (exhibited by 84% of the birds), but no change after the negative treatment. Further analysis demonstrated that sparrows more frequently used the strategy with which they were more successful (usually joining) and that differences in strategy use were correlated with differences in success. These results suggest that adult birds can monitor their success and learn to choose among social foraging strategies in the producerscrounger game.

In essence, the models predict that increasing economic defendability of a resource should lead to increased frequency of aggression among competitors. We question this prediction because it is based on the assumption that individuals that do not possess a resource and must decide whether to attempt aggressive appropriation of another individual's resource face the same economic decision as those that already have possession of a resource and must decide whether to defend against an appropriator's attack. Using an evolutionary game analysis, we explore how changes in group size, clump density, patch richness, and predation hazards affect both the decision to appropriate and defend a resource and interact to predict effects on the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness of individuals. Our model predicts that increasing group size should result in a dome-shaped response of frequency of aggression and a slight decrease in aggressiveness. Increasing clump density is predicted to increase both the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness while increases in clump richness result in reduced aggressiveness at high richness values and a decelerated increase in the frequency of aggression. Finally, predation risk is predicted to increase the frequency of aggression only slightly but to lead to increases in aggressiveness. We compare these predictions to earlier resource defense models. We conclude that most experimental findings agree with our model's predictions but call for explicit experimental tests of our predictions concerning the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness.

Individuals allocate their lifetimes to social learning, individual learning, niche construction to improve the environment, and exploitation of resources according to their genetically determined strategies. The coordinated optimal strategy (COS) is defined as the allocation strategy which maximizes the equilibrium fecundity of the population, as opposed to the convergence stable strategy (CSS), which is the strategy favored by natural selection. Both the COS and CSS are analytically derived and compared. It turns out that, although the levels of the CSS in terms of culture and the environmental quality can be high in a highly viscous population, they are in general much lower than those of the COS. It is argued that the discrepancy between the CSS and COS stems from the producer-scrounger structure inherent in the model. Analysis of transient dynamics reveals that the level of culture and the environmental quality may temporarily undergo drastic increases after sudden changes in parameter values, although they eventually drop down to low values due to the genetic adaptation of the time allocation strategy to the new cultural and environmental backgrounds. Implications of the results for human evolution are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Aquaculture radically alters the ecology of fish and their pathogens. Here we show an increase in the occurrence of the bacterial fish disease Flavobacterium columnare in salmon fingerlings at a fish farm in northern Finland over 23 years. We hypothesize that this emergence was owing to evolutionary changes in bacterial virulence. We base this argument on several observations. First, the emergence was associated with increased severity of symptoms. Second, F. columnare strains vary in virulence, with more lethal strains inducing more severe symptoms prior to death. Third, more virulent strains have greater infectivity, higher tissue-degrading capacity and higher growth rates. Fourth, pathogen strains co-occur, so that strains compete. Fifth, F. columnare can transmit efficiently from dead fish, and maintain infectivity in sterilized water for months, strongly reducing the fitness cost of host death likely experienced by the pathogen in nature. Moreover, this saprophytic infectiousness means that chemotherapy strongly select for strains that rapidly kill their hosts: dead fish remain infectious; treated fish do not. Finally, high stocking densities of homogeneous subsets of fish greatly enhance transmission opportunities. We suggest that fish farms provide an environment that promotes the circulation of more virulent strains of F. columnare. This effect is intensified by the recent increases in summer water temperature. More generally, we predict that intensive fish farming will lead to the evolution of more virulent pathogens.

Sharing among kin may increase indirect fitness [1], but when non-kin are involved, different mechanisms were suggested to act. Occasionally, "tolerated theft" [2, 3] is observed, merely because defending a resource is not cost effective. Sharing may also be explained as "costly signaling" [4, 5], where individuals signal their high qualities by distributing acquired resources, as has been suggested to occur in certain human cultures [6]. Alternatively, a transferred food item might be compensated for in later interactions [7]. In vampire bats, blood sharing reflects reciprocity between non-kin colony members [8-10], and long-term social bonds affect food sharing in chimpanzees [11]. Food may also be exchanged for other goods or social benefits [12-14]. One reciprocity-based explanation for intersexual food sharing is the food-for-sex hypothesis [15-17]. This hypothesis proposes that males share food with females in exchange for mating opportunities. Studies on human hunter-gatherer societies suggest that males with increased foraging success have higher reproductive success [18, 19]. Male chimpanzees, which in contrast to humans do not maintain pair bonds, were suggested to share food with females to increase their mating opportunities [16] (but see [20]). Bats, which are long-lived social mammals [21, 22], provide an opportunity to study long-term social reciprocity mechanisms. We monitored producer-scrounger interactions of a captive Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) colony for more than a year and genetically determined the paternity of the pups that were born in the colony. We found that females carry the young of males from which they used to scrounge food, supporting the food-for-sex hypothesis in this species.

Barou-Dagues, Marie (marie.barou-dagues@umontreal.ca) ; Richard-Dionne, Etienne (etienne.richard-dionne@umontreal.ca) ; Dubois, Frederique (frederique.dubois@umontreal.ca)				Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology		2020	AUG 12 2020	74	9	Article No.: 107	107		English						1	17	There is ample evidence that phenotypic traits are important mate choice criteria. Yet, we still know little about the importance of behavioural plasticity in attracting mates, although females could gain direct and/or indirect fitness benefits by choosing males that can adjust their behaviour to environmental fluctuations. Plasticity in foraging tactic use, particularly, might be a key determinant of fitness that could guide mate choice. In this study, we thus asked whether female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) prefer males exhibiting greater plasticity in their foraging tactic use. We measured individual plasticity in a producer-scrounger game where males and females, playing in turn, were exposed to two seed distribution treatments, and females could monitor the males' behaviour, unbeknownst to them. Subsequently, we measured the time each female spent in front of the males they had previously observed in the expectation that females would exhibit a general preference for males with greater plasticity in tactic use. Contrary to our expectation, we found that females did not unanimously prefer the males exhibiting greater plasticity but differed widely in their preference with more plastic females showing a stronger preference for male plasticity compared to the other females. Thus, our findings suggest that differences among females in their mating preference would contribute to maintaining differences in plasticity in tactic use. Significance statement Mate choice is a crucial decision in an individual's life that directly impacts its fitness. Given that females could benefit from choosing males capable of responding to changes in environmental conditions, we asked in this study whether female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) prefer males exhibiting greater plasticity in their foraging tactic use. We let females observe males expressing plasticity in a social foraging context and scored their mate preference for male plasticity. We found that females differed in their preference for male plasticity in tactic use, with more plastic females exhibiting a stronger preference for male plasticity compared to the others. Our results indicate that behavioural plasticity may be used as a mate choice criterion and hence suggest that mate choice might contribute to maintaining differences in male behavioural plasticity.

J	BACD199800442521		Article		Foraging group size: Models and a test with jaegers kleptoparasitizing terns		Belisle, Marc				Ecology (Washington D C)		1998	Sept., 1998	79	6	1922-1938	1922	1938	English	print					2	15	The formation of foraging groups is likely to result from individual decisions constrained by spatial distribution of food and number of foragers. Foraging groups may form via different mechanisms depending on the absolute levels of at least two relative spatial scales. I present four group size models for environments composed of two nested patch scales. Second-order patches contain first-order patches that correspond to food patches. Individuals within a given second-order patch are able to monitor their conspecifics' behavior, and the number of individuals attending a first-order patch defines group size. I then test the models' predictions with Parasitic Jaegers (Stercorarius parasiticus) kleptoparasitizing fish from Common Terns (Sterna hirundo). In this context, tern fishing grounds and flying terns that carried fish correspond to the jaegers, second and first-order patches, respectively. The Dispersion and Aggregation models assume that foragers have perfect knowledge of the spatial distribution of food and form groups in conformity to an ideal free distribution. The Producer-Scrounger (PS) and Information-Sharing (IS) models, however, assume that foragers are unaware of the food patches' location and form groups as some foragers join and exploit the food discoveries of others. I used four fitness currencies: probability of obtaining a fish, PF; gross and net rates of energy intake; and energy efficiency. All currencies decreased with group size except the PF currency, which did not vary for group sizes of one and two. Because fitness never increased with group size, the Aggregation model was ruled out. Fish-securing rates of jaegers that initiated and joined chases did not differ. Assuming that initiating and joining a chase correspond to a producing and a scrounging event, respectively, both the PS and IS model then predict that group size should match jaeger abundance. Because group size leveled rapidly with jaeger abundance, both models were discarded. The Dispersion model predicts that group size should decrease with an increase in tern availability when the latter is limiting. Otherwise, jaegers should not form groups unless there is no cost to do so, such as with the PF currency in which solitary jaegers and pairs experience equal fitness. The facts that group size did not reach 1.0 at high tern availability and that it averaged 1.5 when it did not decrease further with tern availability suggest that jaegers may form groups according to the Dispersion model with the PF currency. This conclusion is discussed in relation to the other assumptions underlying the Dispersion model.	Belisle, Marc; CRBF, Fac. For. Geomatique, Pavillon Abitibi-Price, Univ.

A mathematical model is presented which shows whether or not scroungers are maintained in a group, depending on their frequency and the group size. Some of the predictions of the model were tested in captive flocks of house sparrows P. domesticus L. Here the scroungers obtained most of their food (mealworms) by interaction and the producers found most of their food by actively foraging: the pay-off to each type was measured as mealworm capture rate. Neither type changed strategy opportunistically in response to instantaneous flock composition, but scroungers fared better when 1 or more producers were present. Scroungers did much worse than expected when greatly outnumbered by producers, perhaps because producers then found the available food quickly.

For instance, it is thought that socially dominant individuals prefer the predator-safe central position of groups forcing subordinates to the periphery. Uneven spread of benefits among group members can occur when some animals (the scroungers) parasitically exploit the food findings of other foragers (the producers). Here we focus on how playing producer or scrounger affects an individual's spatial position within a group. We model the movement of foraging animals playing scrounger or producer using a spatially explicit simulation, and use a genetic algorithm to establish movement rules. We find that groups containing producers and scroungers are more compact compared to an equivalent group of producers only. Furthermore, the position occupied by strategies varies: scroungers are mainly found in central positions, with producers in the periphery, suggesting that the best position for strategies differs. Dominants, therefore, should prefer movement rules which lead to central positions because of the positional benefits provided to the scrounger strategy they use. Moreover, position within a group will introduce an asymmetry among otherwise phenotypically symmetric individuals.	Dep.

Jean M.; Smeltzer, Eve A.; Teichroeb, Julie A. (julie.teichroeb@utoronto.ca)				Animal Behaviour		2021	JUN 2021	176		1-15	1	15	English						2	11	Among social foragers, individuals can actively search for and find food (the producers) or join already discovered food patches (the scroungers). Compared to scroungers, producers often occupy more dangerous outer spatial positions in the group, but they benefit from the finder's advantage, which is the amount of food eaten before the arrival of others. Scroungers may occupy safer positions but they face feeding competition when joining a patch already occupied by others. Here, we report factors influencing intragroup spatial position, feeding strategies and feeding success for a group of wild vervet monkeys, C. pygerythrus, at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda. We collected data using behavioural observations and field experimentation (N 1/4 132 trials) where we set up an artificial food patch with dispersed food rewards. We found that individuals who spent more time in the front-outer position of a moving group produced more. Producers that had a greater finder's time advantage (fed undetected by group members for longer periods) had a greater finder's advantage (consumed more food items before the arrival of other group members), and scroungers that arrived earlier had greater overall feeding success. We found that when the scrounger was higher ranking than other individuals at the patch, they used displacement scrounging (supplanted at least one individual from the patch to gain access to the food resource). However, feeding success did not differ between displacement scrounging and tolerated scrounging (when the scrounger fed at the patch with at least one other individual). Interestingly, we did not find higher-ranking individuals to have greater feeding success than lower-ranking individuals. Our findings corroborate previous studies showing that even among species with a linear dominance hierarchy and high occurrences of within-group contest competition, dominant individuals do not benefit from feeding advantages at large, dispersed food patches since they cannot monopolize the resource. Furthermore, our results emphasize the need to understand factors influencing feeding tolerance, particularly for subordinate individuals, who need to process ecological and social elements to maximize their food acquisition.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

One factor that may influence the choice of foraging strategy is the finder's share, defined as the proportion of the resource consumed by the producer before the arrival of scroungers. Several models predict that when the finder's share is relatively small, the frequency of scrounging will be high because producing gives only a small benefit compared to playing scrounger. A model based on a linear operator learning rule confirmed this prediction and further predicted that individuals would change their foraging strategy gradually in response to environmental changes. We tested these predictions in an experiment involving three groups (N 1/4 18 individuals) of free-ranging black-tufted marmosets, Callithrix penicillata. We manipulated the finder's share at artificial feeding stations by controlling the distribution of food rewards (slices of banana) among baited platforms. We divided our field experiments into two conditions low finder's share (few food-rich patches) and high finder's share (many food-poor patches). Most (15/18) marmosets consumed more banana slices as scroungers in the low finder's share condition than in the high finder's share condition, as expected by the theory. However, individuals did not modify their frequency of use of the strategies in both conditions and did not show gradual learning as expected by the linear operator learning rule. We suggest that in social groups with high levels of tolerance and cooperation, such as those of marmosets, scrounging individuals can have higher foraging success without increasing their searching effort by sharing productive food patches with producers and other scroungers.

We shall show that among equal competitors the optimal patch time for the individual that finds the food patch is shorter than that for the non-finder among equal competitors, T-E lt T-N. This is the case if the patch-finder commences food harvesting in the patch earlier and manages to monopolise a fraction of the prey items (finder's advantage) before the other individuals come to take their benefit. When individuals differ in their food-searching abilities so that some of them (producers) contribute proportionally more to food-searching than others (scroungers), and differ in ability to compete for the food found, a difference emerges between producer and scrounger individuals in the optimal patch time. Within a patch we always have the finder's advantage (T-E lt T-N) regardless of phenotype. Between patches a suite of optimal patch times for encountering individuals emerges depending on the performance of producers and scroungers when changing from solitary feeding to feeding in a group. The optimal patch time for individuals that are affected more severely by competition is shorter than that for individuals of the phenotype with better competitive ability.

However, in this study pigeons who shared the food discoveries of others (scroungers) did not learn the food-finding technique used by the discoverers (producers). Individually-caged pigeons prevented from scrounging easily learned the technique from a conspecific tutor. When caged pigeons obtained food from the tutor's performance, most naive observers failed to learn. In a flock, scroungers selectively followed producers. In individual cages, scrounging during the tutor's demonstration was equivalent to getting no demonstration at all. This effect of scrounging did not interfere with subsequent acquisition of the food-finding behaviour when scrounging was no longer possible.

Numerous studies have described group-size effects on group-average feeding behaviour, particularly emphasizing an increase in scrounging incidence for larger groups, where individuals (scroungers) feed from the food sources others (producers) discovered. However, individual variation in feeding behaviour remains unconsidered in the vast majority of these studies even though theoretical models predict individuals to specialize in feeding tactic and anticipate higher scrounger-type frequencies in larger groups. We combined group level and individual-level analyses of group-size effects on social foraging in the subsocial spider Australomisidia ergandros. Lending novel experimental support to model predictions, we found that individuals specialize in feeding tactic and that higher scrounging and lower producing incidence in larger groups were mediated through shifts in the ratio of feeding types. Further, feeding-type specialization was not explained by innate individual differences in hunting ability as all feeding types were equally efficient in prey capture when foraging alone. Context adaptivity of feeding behaviour might allow this subsocial species to succeed under varying socioecological conditions.

Confusion, overshadowing and frequency-dependent payoffs may all contribute to the inhibition, but standard experimental procedures make the separation of these effects difficult. In this study, we combine characteristics of cage and aviary experiments and present either a single naive pigeon or groups of three naive pigeons with a pre-trained producer opening an apparatus in an aviary. All naive birds scrounged on the 3456 openings they witnessed. In a post-test given in the absence of other birds, all single scroungers opened the apparatus, but only one of the group-scrounging pigeons did. Scrounger numbers appear to play an important role in the inhibition of food-finding behaviour, suggesting that confusion is a major component of learning in a social context.	Lefebvre, Louis; Dep.

At equilibrium, models predict a mixture of the two tactics with equal payoffs. Several factors may constrain the use of tactics and lead to biases in scrounging choices. I explored the effect of prior residence and pair bond as potential constraints on scrounging choices in flocks of zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata). Experimental flocks contained two birds already established in an aviary (prior residents) and two birds recently released in the aviary for the first time (new residents). All birds were previously trained to find food on a foraging grid. In the aviary, new residents followed prior residents from perches to the grid and relied heavily on prior residents to locate food patches. Low initial success by new residents probably favoured heavy reliance on the scrounger tactic. New residents that formed pair bonds with prior residents foraged closer to their mates and scrounged selectively from their mates in some cases. Prior residence, and pair bond to a lesser extent, influenced scrounging choices in zebra finches and could lead to deviation from the expected use of foraging tactics.

While producers rely on personal information and past experience, we may ask whether the tendency to forage as a producer is related to being a better learner. To answer this question, we hand-raised house sparrow (Passer domesticus) nestlings that upon independence were given an individual-learning task that required them to associate colour signal and food presence. Following the testing phase, all fledglings were released into a shared aviary, and their social-foraging tendencies were measured. We found a significant positive correlation between individual's performance in the individual-learning task and subsequent tendency to use searching (producing) behaviour. Individual-learning score was negatively correlated with initial fear of the test apparatus and with body weight. However, the correlation between individual learning and searching remained significant after controlling for these variables. Since it was measured before the birds entered a social group, individual-learning ability could not be the outcome of being a producer. However, the two traits may be initially associated, or individual learning could facilitate producing behaviour. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that associates individual-learning abilities with social-foraging strategies in animal groups.

(vickery.william@uqam.ca)				Ecology and Evolution		2020	MAR 2020	10	6				English						0	5	This study shows, for the first time, that the evolution of a simple behavior, scrounging, at the individual level can have effects on populations, food chains, and community structure. In particular, the addition of scrounging in consumer populations can allow multiple consumers to coexist while exploiting a single prey. Also, scrounging in the top predator of a tritrophic food chain can stabilize interactions between the top predator, its prey, and its prey's prey. This occurs because the payoffs to scrounging for food in a population are negative frequency dependent, allowing scroungers to invade a population and to coexist with producers at a frequency which is density-dependent. The presence of scroungers, who do not search for resources but simply use those found by others (producers) reduces the total amount of resource acquired by the group. As scrounging increases with group size, this leads to less resource acquired per individual as the group grows. Ultimately, this limits the size of the group, its impact on its prey, and its ability to outcompete other species. These effects can promote stability and thus increase species diversity. I will further suggest that prey may alter their spatial distribution such that scrounging will be profitable among their predators thus reducing predation rate on the prey.

Werdenich, Dagmar; Huber, Ludwig (ludwig.huber@univie.ac.at)				Animal Behaviour		2002	November 2002	64	5	771-781	771	781	English	print					1	27	We investigated which factors determine cooperative behaviour of common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, in an instrumental task. During the approach phase each of eight individuals of a family group learned in isolation to pull a handle moving a bowl with attractive food towards its reach. In the following two experimental phases we used 16 dyads. In a dyadic training phase we assessed whether the partners were willing to manipulate the apparatus and to share food. In the subsequent cooperation test we examined whether they were willing to cooperate at a slightly modified apparatus whose solution required one individual (the producer) to pull the handle and the other (the scrounger) to grasp the bowl. Although all individuals were willing to cooperate with at least one partner, only half of the dyads solved the task in the cooperation phase. Examination of the factors that correlated with success in this phase revealed that primarily those dyads cooperated in which the dominant subject took the role of the scrounger and the subordinate took the role of the producer. However, in these successful dyads the dominant animal did not force the subordinate partner to pull the handle. Rather, the partners of cooperative dyads shared the reward and pulled equally often in both the dyadic training and the cooperation test. Thus, cooperation of marmosets in an instrumental task seems to depend on a specific distribution of roles and the tolerance of higher-ranking individuals.

A patch found by one will also be exploited by other members in the group. We are interested in the accumulation of gain of the individual finding the patch, the finder. Finding a patch of prey can lead to asymmetries in foraging success when finders get a larger share of the patch than others. Using renewal processes we have modelled this finder's advantage in gain accumulation and derived expectation and variance of gain. Not surprisingly, the longer the finder's privileged time in exploitation of the food patch, the more its gain resembles that of a solitary forager, while with short finder's time finder's gain is close to that of another non-finding group member. Consider, however, that patch-finding ability might be linked with individual characteristics, some being better finders (producers) than others. If producers are foraging among less skilled finders (scroungers), both the within-patch and between-patch components of gain variance are larger for the producers than if they foraged in a group of individuals of equal patch-finding ability. So, if the foragers are risk-averse, the expectation is for patch-finding skill assorted foraging groups.	Ranta, Esa; Integrative Ecol. Unit, Div. Popul. Biol., Dep. Ecol. Syst., Univ. Helsinki, P.O.

This ISI may either indicate the location of food (social information, SI), or it may indicate the quality of the resource (Public information, PI). To date, few studies have explored the selective consequences for prey of being exploited by predators that use ISI. Prey exploited by such predators should evolve traits that favour high levels of ISI use (scrounging) because this would result in lower predator search efficiency given that fewer predators would be searching directly for the prey. Our Simulations confirm that ISI-using predators should increase their use of ISI when their prey form larger clumps resulting in higher prey survival. Our objective therefore is to explore whether prey will evolve towards higher clumpiness when their predators use ISI, using genetic algorithm Simulation. The prey were subjected to one of three types of predators for over 500 prey generations. The predators either used: (1) no social information (NS), (2) SI only, or (3) PI. Surprisingly, the prey evolved the highest clumpiness for NS predators. Prey evolved towards smaller clump sizes with SI predators and the clumps were marginally larger when predators used PI. The result is due to the prey evolving the minimum clumpiness required to cause maximal ISI use by their predators. We discuss how this response by prey may favour the use of PI over SI in their ISI-using predators.

The high degree of sociality typical of cooperative societies may indicate an important role of social foraging for learning and innovation. We studied 1) social foraging strategies and 2) the acquisition of a novel foraging skill in 16 groups of wild, cooperatively breeding Arabian babblers (Turdoides squamiceps). In Experiment 1, we provided a foraging grid of 96 feeding wells to each group, allowing them either to search for food individually (producer) or to join other birds (scrounger). Subordinates scrounged significantly more than dominant individuals, spent longer on the foraging grid, and had a higher proportion of their foraging steps rewarded (due to the effect of successful scrounging). However, scrounging was not related to poor learning ability because almost all the individuals that learned the novel foraging skill in Experiment 2 (removing a rubber lid to reach food) were scroungers. These findings suggest that group members differ in their foraging strategies and learning abilities according to their rank and that subordinate group members may be more opportunistic and flexible in their behavior than dominants, making use of both scrounging and novel foraging opportunities.

Grouping with kin may reduce the frequency of exploitation because kin selection should favor individuals that imposed fewer costs on their kin. However, taking into account the gains of the exploited individual, allowing kin to exploit one's efforts may be less costly than allowing exploitation from nonkin. In this case, there may be higher frequencies of exploitative behaviors among related than unrelated individuals. In order to understand the net effect of genetic relatedness on intragroup exploitation, we developed a model that considers the inclusive fitness consequences of "producing" (searching for food) and "scrounging" (exploiting the food discoveries of others) when foraging with relatives, while simultaneously allowing individuals to show differential tolerance toward scrounging by kin versus nonkin. The model predicts that increased relatedness can lead to higher levels of exploitation when producers are kin-selected to be more tolerant of scrounging from relatives compared with unrelated scroungers, for example, by being more aggressive toward nonkin. We tested this prediction empirically in captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) foraging either in flocks with full siblings or in flocks of unrelated individuals. Flocks of related zebra finches had higher frequencies of scrounging and lower levels of aggressive interactions compared with flocks of unrelated zebra finches. The results suggest that producers may be kin-selected to allow relatives to scrounge.

Interspecific social information transfer can play a key role in many aspects of animal ecology from foraging to habitat selection to predator avoidance.2. Within scavenging communities, avian scavengers often act as producers and mammalian scavengers act as scroungers, but we predict that species-specific cueing will allow for mammalian scavengers to utilize particular avian scavenger species using preferred food sources similar to their own preferences.3. We use empirical and theoretic approaches to assess interactions between mammalian and avian scavengers in one of the most diverse scavenging guilds in Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya.4. Using a spatially explicit model and data from experimental carcasses, we found evidence that mammals benefit from local enhancement provided by vultures and that mammalian-avian following patterns are consistent with the idea that species-specific cueing is occurring.5. Results suggest that ongoing population declines in avian scavengers may have significant impacts on mammalian scavengers and potentially create trophic cascades.

There was a general spatio-temporal correlation in non-foraging activity among the three species, but foraging activity was correlated only between C. julis and the other two species, but not between S. cinereus and M. surmuletus. There was heterospecific aggregation during foraging between C. julis and M. surmuletus, and possibly a scrounger-producer relationship between them. Fights between C. julis specimens related to foraging activity were common, but not between species. These results support the view that differences in spatio-temporal organization of activity, and interactions during foraging, can contribute to resource partitioning among syntopic populations of fish belonging to the same trophic group.

Here, we model the coevolution between four traits relevant to this setting: (i) investment into common-pool resource production within groups (helping); (ii) proclivity to raid other groups to appropriate their resources (belligerence); and investments into (iii) defense and (iv) offense of group contests (defensive and offensive bravery). We show that when traits coevolve, the population often experiences disruptive selection favouring two morphs: 'Hawks', who express high levels of both belligerence and offensive bravery; and 'Doves', who express neither. This social polymorphism involves further among-traits associations when the fitness costs of helping and bravery interact. In particular, if helping is antagonistic with both forms of bravery, coevolution leads to the coexistence of individuals that either: (i) do not participate into common-pool resource production but only in its defense and appropriation (Scrounger Hawks) or (ii) only invest into common pool resource production (Producer Doves). Provided groups are not randomly mixed, these findings are robust to several modelling assumptions. This suggests that inter-group aggression is a potent mechanism in favouring within-group social diversity and behavioural syndromes.This article is part of the theme issue 'Intergroup conflict across taxa'.

Scrounging may be more advantageous in the centre of the group, having more individuals around to join, while producing may be more beneficial at the edges, where more unexplored food patches may be found. This study shows within-flock position correlates with foraging tactic use of feeding birds in socially foraging tree sparrows, Passer montanus. Sparrows staying closer to the centre of the flock found their food patches more frequently by joining (i.e. use more frequently the scrounging tactic) than those staying toward the edges. To our knowledge this is the first field study demonstrating the relationship between spatial position and foraging tactic use. We investigated this relationship under different perceived predation hazard, and found that under elevated risk of predation, central individuals may increase their use of joining more than individuals on the periphery of the flock. Moreover, we show that extremely specialized use of searching tactics may be very infrequent in tree sparrows. As both within-flock position and search tactic use can be altered very quickly and without leaving the flock, individuals may easily alter them in order to adjust their behaviour.

The foraging behaviour of eusocial animals such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera, is generally considered to be largely regulated by the colony nutritional state. Previous work based on the information primacy hypothesis has however found that honeybee foragers explore (sample resources) and exploit (consume resources) in accordance with their individual nutritional state. We therefore hypothesized that individual and colony nutritional states differ in their influence on individuals of different behavioural phenotypes such as dancers and followers, who are akin to producers and scroungers, respectively. This leads to the prediction that these two behavioural groups will differ with respect to their exploration-exploitation trade-off and in terms of how they prioritize individual and colony nutritional states. We tested our predictions by creating a mismatch between individual and colony nutritional states. Our results show that dancers and followers do not differ in their levels of exploration and exploitation, but dancers are more responsive to colony nutritional state than are followers with regard to managing their exploration-exploitation trade-off. We discuss these results in the context of how these two behavioural phenotypes may differ in their sensitivity to the different nutritional pathways regulating worker behaviour in a eusocial colony and the evolution of sociality in general.

J	BACD201900670790		Article		Personality and social foraging tactic use in free-living Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus)		Fulop, Attila (fulop.attila@science.unideb.hu) ; Nemeth, Zoltan; Kocsis, Bianka; Deak-Molnar, Bettina; Bozsoky, Timea; Barta, Zoltan				Behavioral Ecology		2019	JUL-AUG 2019	30	4	894-903	894	903	English						4	37	Group-foraging individuals often use alternative behavioral tactics to acquire food: some individuals, the producers, actively search for food, whereas others, the scroungers, look for opportunities to exploit the finders' discoveries. Although the use of social foraging tactics is partly flexible, yet some individuals tend to produce more, whereas others largely prefer to scrounge. This between-individual variation in tactic use closely resembles the phenomenon of animal personality; however, the connection between personality and social foraging tactic use has rarely been investigated in wild animals. Here, we studied this relationship in free-living Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) during 2 winters. We found that in females, but not in males, social foraging tactic use was predicted by personality: more exploratory (i.e., more active in a novel environment) females scrounged more. Regardless of sex, the probability of scrounging increased with the density of individuals foraging on feeders and the time of feeding within a foraging bout, that is, the later the individual foraged within a foraging bout the higher the probability of scrounging was. Our results demonstrate that consistent individual behavioral differences are linked, in a sex-dependent manner, to group-level processes in the context of social foraging in free-living tree sparrows, suggesting that individual behavioral traits have implications for social evolution.

With two groups of individually marked, hand-reared greylag goslings we investigated hormonal and behavioural correlates related to the individual's ability to perform operant tasks. During individual tests 6 weeks after hatching, goslings were given small food containers covered by lids. In the following winter the sibling groups were tested in a social set-up at a food dispenser, which the geese could activate by pulling a flap. We analysed individual faecal samples collected at 2, 6 and 12 weeks of age, and also after the individual tests, for excreted corticosterone and testosterone metabolites by enzyme immunoassay. During the individual test, 18 of 23 individuals learned to remove the lids. These 18 birds excreted higher faecal corticosterone concentrations than their respective controls 2 weeks after hatching. At the food dispensers, only four males became food producers; all the others scrounged. These four were in the group of 18 that were successful in the individual test and again tended, although not significantly, to have higher faecal corticosterone 2 weeks after hatching than the scroungers. In one of the groups, excreted corticosterone increased and excreted testosterone decreased after the individual test. Goslings successfully removing lids at 6 weeks raised their faecal corticosterone to a significantly greater extent than the unsuccessful individuals. Our results suggest that becoming an innovator may be contingent upon individual coping styles.

J	BACD201800079670		Article		Does the removal of finder's share influence the scrounging decisions of herbivores?		Kok, Ryan B.; Stears, Keenan; Shrader, Adrian M. (adrian.shrader@up.ac.za)				Animal Behaviour		2017	NOV 2017	133		229-235	229	235	English						0	9	Group-living animals use social information when making patch-joining/scrounging decisions. However, the extent to which they use finder's share (i.e. amount of food eaten in a patch before other individuals arrive) as a cue when making these decisions is unknown. It is likely that the removal of finder's share decreases patch attractiveness to scroungers. However, it is unclear how large a finder's share must be to reduce attractiveness, or how this varies with food availability. To answer these questions, we recorded the patch-joining decisions of dominant goats, Capra hircus, when presented with a choice between an artificial patch where finder's share had been removed by a subordinate patch holder (producer), and one where the patch holder had just started eating. We used time spent feeding by a patch holder (10, 30, 60 and 120 s) as an index of finder's share size, and tested this using three food availabilities (40 g, 100 g and 300 g). At low (40 g) and intermediate (100 g) food availabilities, scrounging goats avoided the finder's share patch once the patch holder had fed for >= 30 s (i.e. 25% and 17% of the food removed, respectively). However, at the highest food availability (300 g), these goats continued to join the finder's share patch even after the patch holder had fed for 120 s (18% removed). Ultimately, our results indicate that goats weigh up both food availability and the finder's share when making scrounging decisions. Nevertheless, finder's share removal was less important in patches with more food. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	BACD200000276486		Article		Multi-species feeding associations in North Sea seabirds: Jointly exploiting a patchy environment		Camphuysen, Kees C. J.; Webb, Andy				Ardea		1999		87	2	177-198	177	198	English	print					1	38	We studied the foraging distribution and the formation of multi-species feeding associations of seabirds and marine mammals off the British east coast. The local top-predator community comprised c. 34 species of seabirds, two pinnipeds and eight cetaceans. It appeared that multi-species feeding associations (MSFA's), with rather low species richness and diversity, were commonly formed around fishing vessels, were attracted by or otherwise associated with cetaceans (MSFA's with a generally low but more variable species richness and moderate diversity) and occurred over natural resources, apparently mainly fish shoals (MSFA's with the highest species richness and diversity). Small, short-lived MSFA's were the commoner type, particularly those over natural prey (sandeels and small clupe-oids). Black-legged Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla acted as catalysts in these flocks, Common Guillemots Uria aalge and Razorbills Alca torda as diving producers, apparently driving up fish towards the surface. The specific role of all other species joining in is described in general terms. Typical associations with marine mammals were those in which the cetaceans (mainly White-beaked Dolphins Lagenorhynchus albirostris and Harbour Porpoises Phocoenaphocoena) operated as 'beaters' for Northern Gannets Motus barsanus and Black-legged Kittiwakes. The functioning of MSFA's is decribed from two angles. First of all, MSFA's are prominent phenomena on the sea surface, guiding seabirds using visual cues for food finding. Secondly, perhaps more importantly, the differentiation of feeding methods deployed in MSFA's may facilitate sea-birds to reach prey that would otherwise be unavailable for them. It is suggested that the frequent associations of Kittiwakes and auks are the most sustainable system, because commensalism is the underlying mechanism rather than competition. The participation of scroungers in these flocks (Herring Gulls Larus argentatus as common nearshore examples) normally ruined the MSFA formation in no time. Usually, a MSFA would usually collapse as soon as the auks gave up their synchronised feeding activities. This underlines the essential role of Alcidae in these formations. The MSFA's are common and prominent in the North Sea and they deserve further study in the context of when interspecific relationships and the structuring of seabird communities.	Camphuysen, Kees C.
