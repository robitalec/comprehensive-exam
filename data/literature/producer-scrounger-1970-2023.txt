We report the most complete demonstration to date of the applicability of the PS foraging game in a free-living animal, the Carib grackle (Quiscalus lugubris) of Barbados. As assumed by PS games, the payoffs obtained by scroungers were negatively frequency dependent. Experimentally, increasing the cost of scrounging led to a decrease in the observed proportion of scroungers, whereas raising the cost of producing increased the proportion of scroungers. Observations of marked birds revealed that group-level changes could be brought about by individual flexibility in tactic use. Despite consistent individual differences in tactic use, most birds used both tactics and could alter their use of producing and scrounging when conditions changed. We found no difference in the payoffs obtained by producers and scroungers, suggesting a symmetrical game equilibrium. Our results call for testing the PS foraging game in a broader range of biological systems that include different types of scrounging behavior (e.g., scramble, stealthful, or aggressive scrounging) as well as the exploitation of different phases of food production (e.g., searching, handling).

Producer-scrounger relationships in yellow-bellied marmots	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						facultatively social; generalist; producer-scrounger; puzzle box; social foraging; yellow-bellied marmot	BEHAVIOR; DOMINANCE	When social animals forage together, they may engage in frequency-dependent strategies either as producers, those who acquire food with their own energy, or as scroungers, those who feed on what the producers discover. An individual's choice of strategy may depend on the frequency of strategies within the group, or it may depend on the individual's own traits. Most of our understanding of producer-scrounger relationships comes from highly social species, but we may gain different insights by studying less social species. We used novel puzzle box experiments to study social foraging relationships and identify the traits associated with strategy choice in facultatively social yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. We found that marmots had consistent strategies as either producers or scroungers. Furthermore, several individuals specialized as scroungers, following the producers to the puzzle box before other scroungers. However, their roles were only associated with sex (males were more likely to produce), and not with age, boldness or dominance rank. Marmots' lack of trait-regulated foraging roles may be associated with their relatively abundant and not-entirely defensible food, or may emerge from their lack of obligate social structure. We discuss how multiple factors may explain variation in social foraging behaviour. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Stable producer-scrounger dynamics in wild birds: sociability and learning speed covary with scrounging behaviour	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Parus major; producer-scrounger games; social network analysis; social learning; social foraging; animal personality	CONSISTENT INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SOCIAL-FORAGING STRATEGIES; TACTIC USE; GREAT TITS; DOMINANCE; INFORMATION; PERSONALITY; EXPLORATION; EFFICIENCY; GAMES	There has been extensive game-theoretic modelling of conditions leading to equilibria of producer-scrounger dichotomies in groups. However there is a surprising paucity of experimental evidence in wild populations. Here, we examine producer-scrounger games in five subpopulations of birds feeding at a socially learnt foraging task. Over four weeks, a bimodal distribution of producers and scroungers emerged in all areas, with pronounced and consistent individual tactic specialization persisting over 3 years. Tactics were unrelated to exploratory personality, but correlated with latency to contact and learn the foraging task, with the late arrivers and slower learners more likely to adopt the scrounging role. Additionally, the social environment was also important: at the broad scale, larger subpopulations with a higher social density contained proportionally more scroungers, while within subpopulations scroungers tended to be central in the social network and be observed in larger foraging flocks. This study thus provides a rare example of a stable, dimorphic distribution of producer-scrounger tactics in a wild population. It further gives support across multiple scales for a major prediction of social foraging theory; that the frequency of scroungers increases with group size.	[Aplin, L.

In behavioral games, what constitutes a good or bad decision about which alternative to use depends on the behavior of other individuals. Solutions to games can take the form of a stable equilibrium frequency (SEF) of alternative tactics. In this study, we ask whether individuals within flocks of ground-feeding passerines (Lonchura punctulata) engaged in a producer-scrounger game adjust their behavior and converge on the SEF by using a fixed rule of thumb or by learning to estimate payoffs by the process of responding to contingencies in reinforcements obtained from each alternative tactic. After being trained either in a high-scrounging (HS) or a low-scrounging (LS) food condition, flocks of birds were provided with identical foraging conditions over 2 successive test phases in which we expected the SEF of scrounging to decrease and then to increase. Birds trained in the HS condition scrounged more than those trained in the LS condition and continued to do so even when subsequently tested in the same conditions. This effect of past experience is inconsistent with the use of a fixed rule alone. An improvement in the efficiency of scrounging behavior within experimental phases provided further evidence of learning in this game-theoretic context. This experiment provides the first empirical evidence that group-level adjustments in scrounger use to different environmental conditions are mediated by learning the payoffs associated with each tactic.

We find that the existence and non-existence of traveling wave solutions are determined by a minimum wave speed c(m) and a threshold value R-0. By constructing a suitable invariant convex set Gamma and applying Schauder fixed point theorem, the existence for c > c(m) , R0 > 1 was established. Besides, a Lyapunov function is constructed subtly to explore the asymptotic behaviors of traveling wave solutions. The non-existences of traveling wave solutions for both c < c(m), Ro > 1 and Ro <= 1, c > 0 were obtained by two-sides Laplace transform and reduction method to absurdity.

The basic version of VRP is Capacitated VRP (CVRP) which considers equal capacities for all vehicles. The most popular way of solving CVRP is splitting the task into two different phases: firstly, assigning customers under different vehicles and secondly, finding optimal route of each vehicle. Sweep clustering algorithm is well studied for clustering customer nodes. On the other hand, route optimization is simply a traveling salesman problem (TSP) and a number of TSP optimization methods are investigated for this purpose. This study investigates a variant of Sweep algorithm for clustering nodes and Producer-Scrounger Method (PSM), the recent swarm intelligence method for TSP, for route generation to get optimal CVRP solution. In conventional Sweep algorithm, cluster formation starts from 00 and consequently advance toward 360 to consider all the nodes. In variant Sweep, cluster formation starts from a user defined angle. We have compared the outcomes of the proposed method with other related methods including recent study on a suite of benchmark CVRPs. The experimental results revealed that proposed method outperformed other methods in solving benchmark CVRPs.	[Akhand, M. A.

Producer-scrounger game models typically overlook the costs and benefits of patch exploitation, assuming instead that producers and scroungers abandon patches simultaneously once depletion occurs. Here we develop an extension of the marginal value theorem of patch exploitation that includes the producer-scrounger dynamics and examine the propensity of a producer to abandon its patch before depletion once scroungers arrive. We predict that early departures should occur more often when expected searching time decreases and when competition intensity in the patch increases. Competition intensity is expected to increase when more scroungers are present or when patches are smaller. We tested these predictions using a within-subject experimental design with six captive flocks of spice finches (Lonchura punctulata), each composed of one producer and three scroungers. As predicted, producers abandoned their food discoveries more frequently once scroungers arrived when searching time was short, when more scroungers were present, and when patches were small. The results show that the producers of a patch often leave as scroungers join their food discoveries because the payoffs from leaving exceed those from staying.

Coevolution of adaptive technology, maladaptive culture and population size in a producer-scrounger game	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						producer-scrounger game; technology; adaptation; maladaptation; individual and social learning; cyclic dynamics	ECONOMIC-GROWTH; EVOLUTION; ORIGIN	Technology (i.e. tools, methods of cultivation and domestication, systems of construction and appropriation, machines) has increased the vital rates of humans, and is one of the defining features of the transition from Malthusian ecological stagnation to a potentially perpetual rising population growth. Maladaptations, on the other hand, encompass behaviours, customs and practices that decrease the vital rates of individuals. Technology and maladaptations are part of the total stock of culture carried by the individuals in a population. Here, we develop a quantitative model for the coevolution of cumulative adaptive technology and maladaptive culture in a 'producer-scrounger' game, which can also usefully be interpreted as an 'individual-social' learner interaction. Producers (individual learners) are assumed to invent new adaptations and maladaptations by trial-and-error learning, insight or deduction, and they pay the cost of innovation. Scroungers (social learners) are assumed to copy or imitate (cultural transmission) both the adaptations and maladaptations generated by producers. We show that the coevolutionary dynamics of producers and scroungers in the presence of cultural transmission can have a variety of effects on population carrying capacity. From stable polymorphism, where scroungers bring an advantage to the population (increase in carrying capacity), to periodic cycling, where scroungers decrease carrying capacity, we find that selection-driven cultural innovation and transmission may send a population on the path of indefinite growth or to extinction.

SPATIAL POPULATION DYNAMICS IN A PRODUCER-SCROUNGER MODEL	DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS-SERIES B			English	Article						Producer-scrounger; scramble kleptoparasitism; spatial ecology; population dynamics; reaction-diffusion	EIGENVALUE PROBLEM; GAME-THEORY; EVOLUTION; KLEPTOPARASITISM; EQUATIONS; ENVIRONMENTS; DISPERSAL; EXISTENCE; FORAGERS; MOVEMENT	The spatial population dynamics of an ecological system involving producers and scroungers is studied using a reaction-diffusion model. The two populations move randomly and increase logistically, with birth rates determined by the amount of resource acquired. Producers can obtain the resource directly from the environment, but must surrender a proportion of their discoveries to nearby scroungers through a process known as scramble kleptoparasitism. The proportion of resources stolen by a scrounger from nearby producers decreases as the local scrounger density increases. Parameter combinations which allow producers and scroungers to persist either alone or together are distinguished from those in which they cannot. Producer persistence depends in general on the distribution of resources and producer movement, whereas scrounger persistence depends on its ability to invade when producers are at steady-state. It is found that (i) both species can persist when the habitat has high productivity, (ii) neither species can persist when the habitat has low productivity, and (iii) slower dispersal of both the producer and scrounger is favored when the habitat has intermediate productivity.

Producer-scrounger roles and joining based on dominance in a free-living group of Mexican jays (Aphelocoma ultramarina)	BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						producer-scrounger; Mexican jay; Aphelocoma ultramarina; group foraging	FORAGING TACTICS; ZEBRA FINCHES; FLOCKS; FOOD; BEHAVIOR; SUCCESS	While foraging, animals often exploit group members to obtain food. One way to describe this behaviour is with the producer-scrounger (PS) model, where scroungers use social interaction to obtain food discovered by producers. Mexican jays (Aphelocoma ultramarina) are a group-foraging species with a linear dominance hierarchy. We studied interactions in a free-living foraging group to determine (1) if foraging interactions can be explained with the PS model, (2) if these roles are consistent and (3) if dominance or relatedness affects joining frequency. We recorded board-flipping, eating, and joining events during sets of feeding trials. We show that Mexican jays use PS roles and that these roles were consistent through many trials, but might have changed between trial sets. Relatedness and frequency of joining were not correlated. Dominance influenced joining in that joining was more likely to occur between birds with a larger difference in their dominance rank. In contrast to other studies, our results suggest that this effect is mediated through joiner preference. Scroungers preferentially joined birds of lower dominance rank and high search activity. Producers with these qualities had fewer eating events with full access to seeds, suggesting that scrounging exacts a cost on producers.

One such situation involves cases where an animal can search for a new resource (produce) or join what others have already found (scrounge). A number of game-theoretic models have been proposed to predict the equilibrium combination of producer and scrounger strategists based on the evolutionarily stable strategy. However, each game model can only handle a few environmental parameters at a time and none address the flexible use of tactics that allows individuals to respond quickly and adaptively to changes in payoffs. In this study we propose an agent-based model using a linear operator learning rule as the decision mechanism. The model provides a unified framework from which to predict the effects on the expected equilibrium of producers and scroungers of group size, metabolic requirement, finder's advantage, food intake rate, cost of searching, cost of joining, patch encounter probability and patch richness. The simulation results replicate almost every producer-scrounger prediction and experimental result published to date such that the simulation provides a more general tool than any single game-theoretic model to predict behaviour under frequency-dependent conditions. The model furthermore allows us to develop a novel prediction about foraging behaviour in a more realistic environment of variable patch richness. By modelling the operation of a plausible decision rule, we can explore the validity of the behavioural gambit, the assumption that the unspecified decision mechanisms of game-theoretic models faithfully reproduce outcomes expected of natural selection operating over generations on fixed alternatives. We suggest that this simulation model can provide a tool for others to explore and predict the effect of more complex and hence realistic foraging conditions on individual levels of producer and scrounger use.

In the proposed method, the swarm is divided into three parts: the producer, scroungers and remainders. The producer is the best individual selected from current population and it exploits the new solution with a random angle and a maximal radius. Some individuals, which are different from the producer, are randomly selected according to a predefined probability as scroungers. The scroungers update their position with an area-copying operator, which is used in the PS model. The remainders are updated by means of teaching and learning operators as they are used in the TLBO algorithm. In each iteration, the computation cost of the proposed algorithm is less than that of the original TLBO algorithm, because the individuals of the PS model are only evaluated once and the individuals of the TLBO algorithm are evaluated two times in each iteration. The proposed algorithm is tested on different kinds of benchmark problems, and the results indicate that the proposed algorithm has competitive performance to some other algorithms in terms of accuracy, convergence speed and success rate.

However, individual differences in social contexts have received less attention. We explored the consistency and temporal persistence of individual differences in tactic use in a producer-scrounger foraging game using two sets of flocks of wild-caught nutmeg mannikins, Lonchura punctulata. With both sets of birds, we observed significant individual differences in tactic use that persisted under different food distributions and when flock members were reunited at a 6-month interval with the same flockmates but not when flock members were different. In another experiment, in which birds with high-scrounging profiles were made to forage in the same flock, the corporate frequency of scrounging was no higher, and the intake rate no lower than in flocks made up of intermediate- or low-frequency scroungers. Taken together our experiments suggest that persistent individual differences can arise from dynamics that are peculiar to the group in which they occur, underlining the importance of companions' identity in determining tactic use in this game. Behavioural plasticity can erase idiosyncratic individual differences in games with frequency-dependent payoffs when group composition changes.

However, the empirical testing of such models has generally been restricted to indoor aviary experiments. Here, we examine the social foraging tactics of naturally foraging wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). Thirty-six adult baboons from 2 groups were observed during full-day follows: Data from nearly 10 000 foraging events were analyzed using cross-classified, generalized linear mixed models. First, as predicted by producer-scrounger models, we show that baboons altered their foraging tactics in accordance with food patch size and spatial position in the group. Second, we show that the relative characteristics of cofeeding individuals were crucial: In particular, among females, individuals were more likely to scrounge from foraging neighbors who were subordinate and with whom they had a strong social affiliation. However, we found no effect of kinship. Finally, we found that female reproductive state influenced female foraging tactics (females scrounged more from male neighbors when pregnant and less when fertile), but the reproductive state of female neighbors had no such effects on male foraging tactics. These results suggest that, in addition to broad-scale ecological and group-level influences, a myriad of social and reproductive factors can shape producer-scrounger dynamics for wild animals living in complex social groups.

J	Ohtsuka, Y; Toquenaga, Y				Ohtsuka, Yasunori; Toquenaga, Yukihiko			The patch distributed producer-scrounger game	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Information-parasitism; Group foraging; Animal aggregation; Evolutionarily stable strategy; Horn's model	INFORMATION-CENTERS	Grouping in animals is ubiquitous and thought to provide group members antipredatory advantages and foraging efficiency. However, parasitic foraging strategy often emerges in a group. The optimal parasitic policy has given rise to the producer-scrounger (PS) game model, in which producers search for food patches, and scroungers parasitize the discovered patches. The N-persons PS game model constructed by Vickery et al. (1991. Producers, scroungers, and group foraging. American Naturalist 137, 847-863) predicts the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) of frequency of producers ((q) over cap) that depends on the advantage of producers and the number of foragers in a group. However, the model assumes that the number of discovered patches in one time unit never exceeds one. In reality, multiple patches could be found in one time unit. In the present study, we relax this assumption and assumed that the number of discovered patches depends on the producers' variable encounter rate with patches (lambda). We show that (q) over cap strongly depends on lambda within a feasible range, although it still depends on the advantage of producer and the number of foragers in a group. The basic idea of PS game is the same as the information sharing (parasitism), because scroungers are also thought to parasitize informations of locations of food patches. Horn (1968) indicated the role of information-parasitism in animal aggregation (Horn, H. S., 1968. The adaptive significance of colonial nesting in the Brewer's blackbird (euphagus cyanocephalus). Ecology 49, 682-646). Our modified PS game model shows the same prediction as the Horn's graphical animal aggregation model; the proportion of scroungers will increase or animals should adopt colonial foraging when resource is spatiotemporally clumped, but scroungers will decrease or animals should adopt territorial foraging if there source is evenly distributed.

Bats are among the most social mammals, often living in colonies of tens to thousands of individuals for dozens of years, yet little is known about their social foraging dynamics. We observed three captive bat colonies for over a year, quantifying > 13,000 social foraging interactions. We found that individuals consistently used one of two foraging strategies, either producing (collecting) food themselves or scrounging it directly from the mouth of other individuals. Individual foraging types were consistent over at least 16 months except during the lactation period when females shifted toward producing. Scroungers intentionally selected whom to interact with when socially foraging, thus generating persistent nonrandom social relationships with two to three specific producers. These persistent producer-scrounger relationships seem to reduce aggression over time. Finally, scrounging was highly correlated with vigilance, and we hypothesize that vigilant-prone individuals turn to scrounging in the wild to mitigate the risk of landing on a potentially unsafe fruit tree. We find the bat colony to be a rich and dynamic social system, which can serve as a model to study the role that social foraging plays in the evolution of mammalian sociality. Our results highlight the importance of considering individual tendencies when exploring social behavior patterns of group-living animals. These tendencies further emphasize the necessity of studying social networks over time.

Cognition and covariance in the producer-scrounger game	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						alternative tactics; field experiment; individual differences; learning; repeatability; social foraging	CULTURAL TRANSMISSION; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; CAPTIVE FLOCKS; BEHAVIOR; WILD; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; FLEXIBILITY; INHIBITION; FORAGERS	The producer-scrounger game is a key element of foraging ecology in many systems. Producing and scrounging typically covary negatively, but partitioning this covariance into contributions of individual plasticity and consistent between individual differences is key to understanding population-level consequences of foraging strategies. Furthermore, little is known about the role cognition plays in the producer-scrounger game. We investigated the role of cognition in these alternative foraging tactics in wild mixed-species flocks of great tits and blue tits, using a production learning task in which we measured individuals' speed of learning to visit the single feeder in an array that would provide them with a food reward. We also quantified the proportion of individuals' feeds that were scrounges ('proportion scrounged'); scrounging was possible if individuals visited immediately after a previous rewarded visitor. Three learning experiments-initial and two reversal learning-enabled us to estimate the repeatability and covariance of each foraging behaviour. First, we examined whether individuals learned to improve their scrounging success (i.e. whether they obtained food by scrounging when there was an opportunity to do so). Second, we quantified the repeatability of proportion scrounged, and asked whether proportion scrounged affected production learning speed among individuals. Third, we used multivariate analyses to partition within- and among-individual components of covariance between proportion scrounged and production learning speed. Individuals improved their scrounging success over time. Birds with a greater proportion scrounged took longer to learn their own rewarding feeder. Although multivariate analyses showed that covariance between proportion scrounged and learning speed was driven primarily by within-individual variation, that is, by behavioural plasticity, among-individual differences also played a role for blue tits. This is the first demonstration of a cognitive trait influencing producing and scrounging in the same wild system, highlighting the importance of cognition in the use of alternative resource acquisition tactics. The results of our covariance analyses suggest the potential for genetic differences in allocation to alternative foraging tactics, which are likely species- and system-dependent. They also point to the need to control for different foraging tactics when studying individual cognition in the wild.

J	Mottley, K; Giraldeau, LA				Mottley, K; Giraldeau, LA			Experimental evidence that group foragers can converge on predicted producer-scrounger equilibria	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							CAPTIVE FLOCKS; SPICE FINCHES; GAME; ENVIRONMENT; BEHAVIOR	When foraging together, animals are often observed to feed from food discoveries of others. The producer-scrounger (PS) game predicts how frequently this phenomenon of food parasitism should occur. The game assumes: (1) at any moment all individuals can unambiguously be categorized as either playing producer (searching for undiscovered food resources) or scrounger (searching for exploitation opportunities), and (2) the payoffs received from the scrounger tactic are negatively frequency dependent; a scrounger does better than a producer when the scrounger tactic is rare, but worse when it is common. No study to date has shown that the payoffs of producer and scrounger conform to the game's assumptions or that groups of foragers reach the predicted stable equilibrium frequency (SEF) of scrounger, whereby both tactics obtain the same payoff. The current study of three captive flocks of spice finches, Lonchura punctulata, provides the first test of the PS game using an apparatus in which both assumptions of the PS game are met. The payoffs to the scrounger, measured as feeding rate (seeds/s), were highly negatively frequency dependent on the frequency of scrounger. The feeding rate for scrounger declined linearly while the rate for producer either declined only slightly or not at all with increasing scrounger frequency. When given the opportunity to alternate between tactics, the birds changed their use of each, such that the group converged on the predicted SEF of scrounger after 5-8 days of testing. Individuals in this study, therefore, demonstrated sufficient plasticity in tactic use such that the flock foraged at the SEF of scrounger. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

To maximize food returns, producers should distance themselves from potential competitors whereas scroungers should increase proximity to potential producers. We investigated the extent to which playing one or the other tactic affected an individual's location in captive flocks of ground-feeding spice finches (Lonchura punctulata) as they foraged for hidden clumps of food on an aviary floor. We constrained some individuals to use the producer tactic by pre-training them to find food hidden under lids. Constrained producers foraged significantly further from the center of flocks than constrained scroungers. Flocks with many scroungers were significantly more compact than flocks with fewer scroungers. The results are consistent with published simulations of spatially explicit producer-scrounger models and suggest that the use of producer and scrounger foraging tactics be included as a factor that affects an individual's position within foraging groups.

The foraging benefits of group living include increased efficiency and reduced need for vigilance, but social foraging can also encourage theft of captured prey from conspecifics. The payoffs of stealing prey from others (scrounging) versus capturing prey (producing) may depend not only on the frequency of each foraging strategy in the group but also on an individual's ability to steal. By observing the foraging behavior of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), we found that, within a group, relatively smaller coho acted primarily as producers and took longer to handle prey, and were therefore more likely to be targeted by scroungers than relatively larger coho. Further, our observations suggest that the frequency of scrounging may be higher when groups contained individuals of different sizes. Based on these observations, we developed a model of phenotype-limited producer-scrounger dynamics, in which rates of stealing were structured by the relative size of producers and scroungers within the foraging group. Model simulations show that when the success of stealing is positively related to body size, relatively large predators should tend to be scroungers while smaller predators should be producers. Contrary to previous models, we also found that, under certain conditions, producer and scrounger strategies could coexist for both large and small phenotypes. Large scroungers tended to receive the highest payoff, suggesting that producer-scrounger dynamics may result in an uneven distribution of benefits among group members thatunder the right conditionscould entrench social positions of dominance.

Indeed, personality shows heritable variation and has been linked to fitness in many species. However, the fitness effects of personality are highly variable within and between species. Furthermore, the nature of the causal influence of personality on an organism's fitness remains unclear so far. Competition has been proposed as a factor modulating this relationship. Thus, personality has been found to affect individual success in competition by interference in a few species, but its influence in scramble competition remains unexplored. We assessed exploratory tendencies (thought to be a key component of personality) in a model species, the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. In a first session, we formed foraging flocks composed of four individuals with different exploration scores, and allowed them to play producer-scrounger games repeatedly. During a second session, individuals were reassigned to different flocks to check for consistency in the influence of exploratory tendency across different social contexts. Exploratory tendency influenced individual feeding success during the first session but not during the second one. High-exploratory birds were less successful at finding food (i.e. playing the producer tactic) and consequently had a lower feeding success, but were presumably able to adjust their behaviour between sessions. We discuss our results in relation to the interactive effects of both personality and experience, and highlight the role of competition processes on the evolution of personality.

J	Barta, Z; Giraldeau, LA				Barta, Z; Giraldeau, LA			Daily patterns of optimal producer and scrounger use under predation hazard: A state-dependent dynamic game analysis	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						social foraging; producer-scrounger game; state-dependent dynamic game	FORAGING SUCCESS; CAPTIVE FLOCKS; JUNCO-HYEMALIS; DAILY ROUTINES; GROUP-SIZE; BEHAVIOR; RISK; DOMINANCE; ENVIRONMENT; STRATEGIES	Feeding in groups often gives rise to joining: feeding From other's discoveries. The joining decision has been modeled as a producer-scrounger game where the producer strategy consists of searching for one's food and the scrounger strategy consists of searching for food discovered by others. Previous models revealed that the evolutionarily stable proportion of scrounging mostly depends on the fraction of each food patch available only to its producer. These early models are static and state independent and are therefore unable to explore whether the time of day, the animal's state, and the degree of predation hazard influence an individual's decision of whether to use the producer or scrounger strategy. To investigate these issues, we developed a state-dependent dynamic producer-scrounger game model. The model predicts that, early in the day, low reserves promote a preference for the scrounger strategy, while the same condition late in the day favors the use of the producer strategy. Under rich and clumped food, the availability of scrounging can improve the daily survival of any average group member. The model suggests only weak effects of predation hazard on the use of scrounging. Future developments should consider the effects of dominance asymmetries and allowing foragers a choice between foraging alone or in a group harboring an evolutionarily stable Frequency of scrounger.

Individuals can either search for food sources themselves (producing) or they can join food discoveries of others (scrounging). In this study we use a genetic algorithm in a spatially explicit producer-scrounger game to explore how individuals compromise between exploration (an important axis of animal personality) and scrounging and how characteristics of the environment affect this compromise. Agents varied in exploration and scrounging and a genetic algorithm searched for the optimal combination of exploration and scrounging. The foraging environments featured different levels of patch richness, predation and patch density. Our simulations show that under conditions of low patch densities slow exploring scroungers were favored whereas high patch density favored fast exploring individuals that either produced (at low patch richness) or scrounged (at high patch richness). In high predation environments fast exploring individuals were selected for but only at low to intermediate patch densities. Predation did not affect scrounging behavior. We did not find a divergence of exploration 'types' within a given environment, but there was a general association between exploration and scrounging across different environments: high rates of scrounging were observed over nearly the full spectrum of exploration values, whereas high rates of producing were only observed at high exploration values, suggesting that cases in which slow explorers start producing should be rare. Our results indicate that the spatial arrangement of food resources can affect the optimal social attraction rules between agents, the optimality of foraging tactic and the interaction between both.

The use of producer and scrounger strategies has been modelled as an alternative-option scramble which assumes strong negative frequency-dependence of the scrounger's pay-offs. We tested this assumption in a flock feeding situation by manipulating the proportion of scroungers in flocks of spice finches, Lonchura punctulata. In a first experiment we found that: (1) the food intake of scroungers, and to a lesser extent producers, was negatively affected by an increase in the proportion of scroungers; (2) the food intake of producers and scroungers was equal when the proportion of scroungers was small, suggesting that producers, who exploited 35.4% of their patches by scrounging were opportunistically adjusting their use of the strategies until the pay-offs equalized. In a second experiment we tested whether finches could vary their use of the two strategies in response to changes in foraging conditions brought about by an increase in the cost of producing. As predicted by the game, finches reduced their use of the producer strategy and increased their use of the scrounger strategy when the cost of producing increased. These results suggest that spice finches can alter their allocation to each foraging alternative by experience and that the producer-scrounger game is a realistic model for predicting group foraging decisions.

Previous experimental inquiries have demonstrated that individuals vary in their tendency to play either tactic but the extent to which individual factors influence variation in foraging behavior are little studied. In the present study, we have assessed the influence of natural variation in body condition on the differential use of social foraging tactics and their resulting payoffs in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). The producer tactic was found to yield more consistent and predictable rewards across trials than the scrounger tactic. The use of producer was related to reduced variation in food intake and an increased amount of food consumed. We found that poor-condition birds were more likely to produce and so consumed more seeds than good-condition birds. The results are consistent with theoretical models of variance-sensitive social foraging but suggest that scrounging may not represent a variance-averse option in all situations. We propose that in a producer-scrounger context, the variance-averse option may depend on group size and food clumping. Finally, we discuss our results in relation to interindividual differences in metabolism and behavior.

J	Koops, MA; Giraldeau, LA				Koops, MA; Giraldeau, LA			Producer-scrounger foraging games in starlings: A test of rate-maximizing and risk-sensitive models	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							ENVIRONMENT; STRATEGIES; DOMINANCE; FLOCKING; BEHAVIOR; SUCCESS	Social foragers obtain food through two tactics: 'producer' searches for its food, and 'scrounger' exploits food discovered by producer. In the recent literature, two alternative producer-scrounger (P-S) models have been proposed, one rate-maximizing, the other risk-sensitive. Their predictions differ about the effect of food clump density on the equilibrium proportional use of scrounger in a group. The rate-maximizing model predicts no effect, whereas the risk-sensitive model predicts that the proportional use of scrounger should increase with food clump density. These predictions were tested using wild-caught European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, in an indoor aviary. Increased food clump density resulted in significant increases in the proportional use of scrounger. Proportional use of scrounger was negatively related to food intake variance as assumed by the risk-sensitive model. Thus, scrounger is a risk-averse foraging tactic, and starlings used it in a risk-sensitive fashion. The risk-sensitive model was further challenged by testing its prediction concerning daily food requirement. When producer has a low competitive efficiency, as was found in these starlings, the risk-sensitive model predicts weakly positive effects, if any, of increased requirement on proportional use of scrounger. Results were consistent with this prediction. A significant number of starlings showed consistently positive effects of requirement on proportional use of scrounger, but the magnitude of this increase was non-significant. The results of both experiments taken together show that the proportional use of scrounger tactics within foraging groups may be a risk-sensitive, rather than a rate-maximizing, foraging tactic.

J	Beauchamp, G				Beauchamp, G			Learning rules for social foragers: Implications for the producer-scrounger game and ideal free distribution theory	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							PATCHY ENVIRONMENT; INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS; PREDATORS; EXPLOITATION; INFORMATION; MODEL; TIME	In population games, the optimal behaviour of a forager depends partly on courses of action selected by other individuals in the population. How individuals learn to allocate effort in foraging games involving frequency-dependent payoffs has been little examined. The performance of three different learning rules was investigated in several types of habitats in each of two population games. Learning rules allow individuals to weigh information about the past and the present and to choose among alternative patterns of behaviour. In the producer-scrounger game, foragers use producer to locate food patches and scrounger to exploit the food discoveries of others. In the ideal free distribution game, foragers that experience feeding interference from companions distribute themselves among heterogeneous food patches. In simulations of each population game, the use of different learning rules induced large variation in foraging behaviour, thus providing a tool to assess the relevance of each learning rule in experimental systems. Rare mutants using alternative learning rules often successfully invaded populations of foragers using other rules indicating that some learning rules are not stable when pitted against each other. Learning rules often closely approximated optimal behaviour in each population game suggesting that stimulus-response learning of contingencies created by foraging companions could be sufficient to perform at near-optimal level in two population games.

J	Coolen, I				Coolen, I			Increasing foraging group size increases scrounger use and reduces searching efficiency in nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura punctulata)	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						group size; nutmeg mannikins; producer-scrounger; searching efficiency; social foraging	CAPTIVE FLOCKS; HOUSE SPARROWS; SPICE FINCHES; PRODUCER; INTERFERENCE; ENVIRONMENT; BEHAVIOR; PATCHES; VIGILANCE; GEOMETRY	Social foragers can benefit from others' success by joining and sharing their food discoveries. In a producer-scrounger (PS) system, foragers can either search for food themselves (play producer) or search for joining opportunities (play scrounger), but not both at the same time. Empirical evidence is accumulating to show that the joining decision of ground-feeding birds like nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura punctulata) can be modeled by a PS game. However some predictions remain to be tested. For instance, foragers are predicted to increase their use of the scrounger tactic as group size increases. Also, one consequence of the incompatibility between producer and scrounger tactics is that the per capita searching efficiency should decrease as the use of scrounger increases. I tested these predictions in an indoor aviary using four flocks of nutmeg mannikins. I manipulated the stable equilibrium frequency (SEF) of the scrounger tactic by varying group size and the finder's share. As predicted by PS games, birds increased their use of scrounger as group size increased. Also, the per capita interval between patch discoveries increased and the per capita finding rate decreased as conditions called for a higher SEF of scrounger. I discuss why the decreased searching efficiency observed likely follows from the incompatibility between producer and scrounger tactics rather than from artifacts of the conditions used or from any form of interference.

J	Barta, Z; Giraldeau, LA				Barta, Z; Giraldeau, LA			Breeding colonies as information centers: a reappraisal of information-based hypotheses using the producer-scrounger game	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article							EVOLUTION; RECRUITMENT; STRATEGIES; ADVANTAGES; SELECTION; PATTERNS	One of the most cited hypotheses for the evolutionary advantages of colonial breeding proposes that colonies serve as a place of information exchange about the location of food-the information center hypothesis. Despite its popularity, the hypothesis generated considerable controversy over its predictions and role in the evolution of colonial breeding. As a consequence, the hypothesis still lingers on, despite numerous apparent falsifcations from both observational and experimental approaches. The controversy has three roots: the unclear causal direction between coloniality and information center, the unrecognized distinction between colonial breeding and colonial roosting, and the use of an implicit group selectionist argument. Here we try to clarify this controversy by applying an entirely individual selection-based approach, the producer-scrounger game, to the information center hypothesis. Furthermore, we show how other information-based alternatives of the original information center hypothesis (e.g., local enhancement and recruitment center hypotheses) can be included in a common framework. Our model predicts that individuals relying on information transfer at die colony should be rather common in nature. This prediction is essentially unaltered by the inclusion of either local enhancement or recruitment center. On the other hand, the frequency of leading unknowledgeable: individuals (the most accepted sign of information center) is expected to be very low. The model indicates that tests of information-based hypotheses should focus on the expected relative frequency of food-searching flights rather than the frequency of leading.

Tactic use in producer-scrounger games is partly flexible but individuals tend to show consistency in tactic use under different conditions suggesting that personality might play a role in tactic use in producer-scrounger games. Here we studied the use of producing and scrounging tactics by bold and shy barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis), where boldness is a personality trait known to be repeatable over time in this species. We defined individuals as bold, shy or intermediate based on two novel object tests. We scored the frequency of finding food patches (the outcome of investing in producing) and joining patches (the outcome of investing in scrounging) by bold and shy individuals and their feeding time. Shy individuals had a higher frequency of joining than bold individuals, demonstrating for the first time that personality is associated with tactic use in a producer-scrounger game. Bold individuals tended to spend more time feeding than shy individuals. Our results highlight the importance of including individual behavioural variation in models of producer-scrounger games.

Relying on a recent mathematical model, we here test the prediction that the emergence of differences in within-individual consistency is related to the sequential access to resources in a frequency-dependent foraging game. To this end we used flocks of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) engaged in a producer-scrounger foraging game. Tactic investment (i.e., the proportion of hops with the head down) significantly predicted successful tactic use (i.e., the proportion of seeds produced). In support of predictions, we found that individuals that arrived first at a foraging area were more consistent in both their investment into and their use of the producer tactic. Also, birds in higher body condition were less consistent in their producer tactic use. These results provide the first evidence that variation in behavioral consistency can emerge through the sequential access to resources in a frequency-dependent game. They also highlight a potential physiological cost of behavioral flexibility. Our findings suggest an explanation for the link between personality traits and social information use.

If searching for food and searching for exploitation opportunities within a group are mutually exclusive alternatives, the decision to use one or the other is modeled as a producer-scrounger game because the value of each alternative is frequency dependent. Stochastic producer-scrounger models generally assume that producer provides a more variable and uncertain reward than does the scrounger and hence is a riskier foraging alternative. Socially foraging animals that are attempting to reduce their risk of starvation should therefore alter their use of producer and scrounger alternatives in response to changes in energy budget. We observed flocks of nutmeg mannikins (L. punctulata) foraging in an indoor aviary to determine whether their use of producer and scrounger alternatives were risk sensitive. Analyses of the foraging rewards of three flocks of seven birds confirm that producer is a riskier foraging strategy than is scrounger, although the difference in risk is rather small. We then submitted two other flocks to two different energy budgets and observed the foraging decision of four focal birds in each flock. All but one bird increased their relative use of the riskier producer strategy in the low food reserve treatment, but the overall use of producer did not differ significantly between treatments, providing evidence for a small but consistent effect.

While these alternative behaviours are well documented, it is not clear to what extent an individual's tendency to forage independently or to follow others is under genetic control or rather is affected by experience. To examine whether hand-reared juveniles can learn to prefer using a producer or a scrounger tactic, we hand-reared house sparrow, Passer domesticus, nestlings that upon. edging were assigned to one of two training groups; the first was expected to enhance joining ( scrounging) behaviour and the second to enhance searching ( producing) behaviour. In the first group, fledglings were imprinted on a parent model ( stuffed female sparrow) that visited locations containing food. In the second group,fledglings were imprinted on a parent model that visited locations containing no food, while food was available in different locations. At the end of a 5-day training phase, all fledglings were released into a shared aviary, and their social foraging tendencies were measured. We found that fledglings from the first group used significantly more joining behaviour than fledglings from the second group, suggesting that an individual whose early experience positively reinforced joining behaviour is more likely to later become a joiner. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence for the effect of learning on the choice between social foraging strategies in the context of the producere scrounger game.

Participants designed "virtual arrowheads" and tested them in "virtual hunting environments", improving their designs through either individual trial-and-error learning or by copying the design of another participant. A previous study using this task [Mesoudi, A., & O'Brien, M. J. (2008). The cultural transmission of Great Basin projectile point technology 1: An experimental simulation. American Antiquity, 73, 3-28.] found that a cultural learning strategy Of "copy-successful-individuals" was significantly more adaptive than individual learning. The present study explored the robustness of this finding using the same task but under different conditions. It was found that (a) individual learning was significantly more adaptive in a unimodal adaptive landscape than in a multimodal adaptive landscape, suggesting that the adaptive advantage of cultural learning would disappear in unimodal environments; (b) the adaptive advantage of copy-successful-individuals was maintained when cultural learning was permitted at regular intervals. despite the increased opportunity for information scroungers to inhibit exploration of the environment, because participants flexibly switched between individual and cultural learning depending on circumstances; (c) allowing participants to set access costs that other participants must pay in order to view their designs severely curtailed the use of cultural learning and especially the copy-successful-individuals strategy.

Since individual differences in learning ability could be a source of differences in behavioural plasticity, the frequency dependence of payoffs within a foraging group may permit the coexistence of both plastic, fast-learning individuals and nonplastic, slow-learning individuals; in a frequency-dependent context the adjustments of a few benefit all. In this study, we investigated whether individuals that learned faster in a simple associative learning task were also more likely to adjust their behaviour in a social foraging game context than their slower-learning groupmates. We measured the associative learning ability of female Bengalese finches, Lonchura striata domestica, in a colour discrimination task and their degree of behavioural plasticity in tactic use when foraging conditions called for changes in the flock's producer-scrounger equilibrium. We found that behavioural plasticity was affected by learning speed. However, in contrast to our expectation, the slower learners were most plastic. We argue that behavioural plasticity in the producer-scrounger game context may require learning that is different from colour matching. We also propose that our results may be related to the fast-slow continuum; being proactive or fast and inaccurate could favour being responsive in simple asocial contexts while being reactive or slow and accurate could favour being plastic in more complex social contexts. Future empirical studies need to compare differences in behavioural plasticity in tactic use with learning speed measured in other types of learning tasks and with personality traits relevant to the fast-slow continuum.

While experimental evidence in the producer-scrounger game suggests that learned strategy choice may be common, a recent theoretical analysis demonstrated that learning by only some individuals prevents learning from evolving in others. Here, however, we model learning explicitly, and demonstrate that learning can easily evolve in the whole population. We used an agent-based evolutionary simulation of the producer-scrounger game to test the success of two general learning rules for strategy choice. We found that learning was eventually acquired by all individuals under a sufficient degree of environmental fluctuation, and when players were phenotypically asymmetric. In the absence of sufficient environmental change or phenotypic asymmetries, the correct target for learning seems to be confounded by game dynamics, and innate strategy choice is likely to be fixed in the population. The results demonstrate that under biologically plausible conditions, learning can easily evolve in the whole population and that phenotypic asymmetry is important for the evolution of learned strategy choice, especially in a stable or mildly changing environment.

For both, small and large groups, the number of production opportunities per capita was equal. Foraging strategies were classified as either production (opening gates with food) or scrounging (following conspecifics). Small groups showed a higher proportion of producers than large groups and required less time to deplete the food. The proportion of producing and scrounging responses yields to equilibrium between their payoffs. Producing and scrounging were highly correlated with different prior responses. Also, the relative frequency of producing and scrounging associated activities correlated with the time spent consuming food procured by each activity. It is possible that a simple outcome-strategy feedback mechanism mediates the choice of prior activities and procurement responses.

We tested whether group formation by a kleptoparasitic fish, the western buffalo bream (Kyphosus cornelii), fit the predictions of five social foraging models. Two aggregation economy models assumed that there was some benefit to grouping shared by group members, such as reduced predation risk or increased ability to gain access to resources. These models and a third, the dispersion (ideal free) economy model, assumed that kleptoparasites had perfect information regarding the quality of opportunities for kleptoparasitism. The other two models did not make this assumption. These producer-scrounger models assumed that some kleptoparasites (producers) discovered opportunities, while others used producers to reduce the costs of foraging. These last two models differed in whether foragers could estimate the state of current opportunities for kleptoparasitism. We compared typical group size, and the influence of group size on intake rate and the success of kleptoparasitic attempts, with the predictions of these models. We found that typical group size was larger during periods. when opportunities for kleptoparasitism were poor than when good and that there was no influence of group size on the likelihood that the group was successful at kleptoparasitizing. Individual intake rate declined with group size for small group sizes, but increased with group size in large groups. However, large groups were rare. For small groups, only a producer-scrounger model allowing foragers to update their information could not be rejected. For large groups, neither that model nor the aggregation economy with foraging benefits model could be rejected. We compare these results with those of other studies of kleptoparasitic groups.

This resource can be food or a territory, and in some situations, potentially divisible. In a previous paper we considered a producer and scrounger competing for an indivisible resource, where each individual could choose the level of energy that they would invest in the contest. The higher the investment, the higher the probability of success, but also the higher the costs incurred in the contest. In that paper decisions were sequential with the scrounger choosing their strategy before the producer. In this paper we consider a version of the game where decisions are made simultaneously. For the same cost functions as before, we analyse this case in detail, and then make comparisons between the two cases. Finally we discuss some real examples with potentially variable and asymmetric energetic investments, including intraspecific contests amongst spiders and amongst parasitoid wasps. In the case of the spiders, detailed estimates of energetic expenditure are available which demonstrate the asymmetric values assumed in our models. For the wasps the value of the resource can affect the probabilities of success of the defender and attacker, and differential energetic investment can be inferred. In general for real populations energy usage varies markedly depending upon crucial parameters extrinsic to the individual such as resource value and intrinsic ones such as age, and is thus an important factor to consider when modelling.

J	Barta, Z; Giraldeau, LA				Barta, Z; Giraldeau, LA			The effect of dominance hierarchy on the use of alternative foraging tactics: A phenotype-limited producing-scrounging game	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						dominance hierarchy; game theory; group foraging; phenotype limitation; producer-scrounger	CONVICT CICHLIDS; CAPTIVE FLOCKS; JUNCO-HYEMALIS; GROUP-SIZE; FOOD; SPARROWS; BEHAVIOR; MONOPOLIZATION; LOCATIONS; STRATEGY	Group living is thought to be advantageous for animals, though it also creates opportunities for exploitation. Using food discovered by others can be described as a producer-scrounger, frequency-dependent game. In the game, scroungers (parasitic individuals) do better than producers (food finders) when scroungers are rare in the group, but they do worse when scroungers are common. When the individuals' payoffs do not depend on their phenotype (i.e. a symmetric game), this strong negative frequency dependence leads to a mixed stable solution where both alternatives obtain equal payoffs. Here, we address the question of how differences in social status in a dominance hierarchy influence the individuals' decision to play producer or scrounger in small foraging groups. We model explicitly the food intake rate of each individual in a dominance-structured foraging group, then calculate the Nash equilibrium for them. Our model predicts that only strong differences in competitive ability will influence the use of producing or scrounging tactics in small foraging groups; dominants will mainly play scrounger and subordinates will mostly use producer. Since the differences in competitive ability of different-ranking individuals likely depend on the economic defendability of food, our model provides a step towards the integration of social foraging and resource defence theories.

J	Dubois, F; Morand-Ferron, J; Giraldeau, LA				Dubois, Frederique; Morand-Ferron, Julie; Giraldeau, Luc-Alain			Learning in a game context: strategy choice by some keeps learning from evolving in others	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						learning; polymorphism; frequency dependence; producer-scrounger game; personality; behavioural syndrome	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EXPLORATORY-BEHAVIOR; EVOLUTION; RULES; FOOD; PERSONALITY; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; BOLDNESS	Behavioural decisions in a social context commonly have frequency-dependent outcomes and so require analysis using evolutionary game theory. Learning provides a mechanism for tracking changing conditions and it has frequently been predicted to supplant fixed behaviour in shifting environments; yet few studies have examined the evolution of learning specifically in a game-theoretic context. We present a model that examines the evolution of learning in a frequency-dependent context created by a producer-scrounger game, where producers search for their own resources and scroungers usurp the discoveries of producers. We ask whether a learning mutant that can optimize its use of producer and scrounger to local conditions can invade a population of non-learning individuals that play producer and scrounger with fixed probabilities. We find that learning provides an initial advantage but never evolves to fixation. Once a stable equilibrium is attained, the population is always made up of a majority of fixed players and a minority of learning individuals. This result is robust to variation in the initial proportion of fixed individuals, the rate of within-and between-generation environmental change, and population size. Such learning polymorphisms will manifest themselves in a wide range of contexts, providing an important element leading to behavioural syndromes.

Dominance, pair bonds and boldness determine social-foraging tactics in rooks, Corvus frugilegus	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						boldness; Corvus frugilegus; dominance; individual differences; heterogeneity; pair bond; personality; producer-scrounger; rook; social foraging	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; HAEMATOPUS-OSTRALEGUS; SCROUNGING BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS; ENERGY RESERVES; CAPTIVE FLOCKS; ZEBRA FINCHES; PRODUCER; PERSONALITY; KLEPTOPARASITISM	Socially foraging animals can search for resources themselves (produce) or exploit the discoveries made by others (scrounge). The extensive literature on producer-scrounger dynamics has mainly focused on scramble competition over readily accessible resources, thereby largely neglecting the variety of scrounging techniques individuals may use as well as the role of investment in food handling. Furthermore, although individual differences in boldness and social factors such as dominance have been described to influence foraging tactics, their potential interplay and effect in foraging contexts beyond the conventional producer-scrounger game remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between social-foraging tactic use and dominance, pair bonds and boldness in a foraging experiment focused on food handling and alternative scrounging tactics. We conducted a producer-scrounger experiment in a captive group of rooks in which individuals could produce by pulling up baited strings, or scrounge by retrieving fallen food items or joining a producer. There were three key findings: (1) dominant rooks adopted the producer tactic more often and more successfully than subordinates; (2) producing and scrounging by tolerance led to mixed benefits to paired birds; (3) bold birds scrounged by retrieving more often than shy birds. Importantly, individuals were highly consistent in their tactic use across conditions differing in food availability. Our study highlights the importance of taking both social factors and boldness (heterogeneity) into account when studying social-foraging dynamics and offers empirical data on food handling and alternative scrounging tactics that can be used to extend current models and experiments on social foraging.

While it is well known that vultures use intraspecific social information as they forage, the possibility of inter-guild social information transfer and the resulting multi-species social dilemmas has not been explored. Here, we use data on arrival times at carcasses to show that such social information transfer occurs, with raptors acting as producers of information and vultures acting as scroungers of information. We develop a game-theoretic model to show that competitive asymmetry, whereby vultures dominate raptors at carcasses, predicts this evolutionary outcome. We support this theoretical prediction using empirical data from competitive interactions at carcasses. Finally, we use an individual-based model to show that these producer-scrounger dynamics lead to vultures being vulnerable to declines in raptor populations. Our results show that social information transfer can lead to important non-trophic interactions among species and highlight important potential links among social evolution, community ecology and conservation biology. With vulture populations suffering global declines, our study underscores the importance of ecosystem-based management for these endangered keystone species.

J	Kameda, T; Nakanishi, D				Kameda, T; Nakanishi, D			Cost-benefit analysis of social/cultural learning in a nonstationary uncertain environment - An evolutionary simulation and an experiment with human subjects	EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						social learning; cultural transmission; conformity; nonstationary environment; producer-scrounger equilibrium	CULTURAL TRANSMISSION; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; BEHAVIOR	Social/cultural learning is an effective way to reduce uncertainty about the environment, helping individuals adopt an adaptive behavior cheaply. Although this is evident for learning about temporally stable targets, such as acquisition of a skill in avoiding toxic foods, the utility of social/cultural learning in a temporally unstable environment is less clear, since knowledge acquired by social learning may be outdated. This paper addresses the adaptive value of social/cultural learning in a nonstationary environment both theoretically and empirically. We first conducted an evolutionary computer simulation that extended Henrich and Boyd's [Evol. Hum. Behav. 19 (1998) 215.] model of cultural transmission, with the following results. When individual learning about the nonstationary environment is costly, a mixed equilibrium emerges in the population, where members who engage in costly individual learning and members who skip the information search and free-ride on other members' search efforts coexist at a stable ratio. Such a "producer-scrounger" structure qualifies effectiveness of social/cultural learning severely, especially "conformity bias" when using social information. We then tested these propositions by an experiment implementing a nonstationary uncertain environment in a laboratory. The results supported our thesis. Implications of these findings and some future directions are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Dubois, F; Richard-Dionne, E				Dubois, Frederique; Richard-Dionne, Etienne			Consequences of multiple simultaneous opportunities to exploit others' efforts on free riding	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						evolutionary stable strategy; game theory; producer-scrounger game; simultaneous scrounging opportunities; stochastic effects	NUTMEG MANNIKINS; SCROUNGER USE; GROUP-SIZE; PRODUCER; INTERFERENCE; PROVISION	Individuals within a group do not all act in the same way: Typically, the investors (or producers) put efforts into producing resources while the free riders (or scroungers) benefit from these resources without contributing. In behavioral ecology, the prevalence of free riders can be predicted by a well-known game-theoretical model-the producer-scrounger (PS) model-where group members have the options to either search for resources (producers) or exploit the efforts of others (scroungers). The PS model has received some empirical support, but its predictions, surprisingly, are based on the strict assumption that only one resource can be exploited at a time. Yet, multiple simultaneous opportunities to exploit others' efforts should frequently occur in nature. Here, we combine analytic and simulation approaches to explore the effect of multiple simultaneous scrounging opportunities on tactic use. Our analyses demonstrate that scrounging rates should increase with the number of simultaneous opportunities. As such, the amount and spatial distribution (i.e., clumped vs. dispersed) of resources as well as the risk of predation are key predictors of scrounging behavior. Because scroungers contribute to reducing the speed of resource exploitation, the model proposed here has direct relevance to the exploitation and sustainability of renewable resources.
