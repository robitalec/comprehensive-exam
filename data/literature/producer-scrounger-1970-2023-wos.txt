We report the most complete demonstration to date of the applicability of the PS foraging game in a free-living animal, the Carib grackle (Quiscalus lugubris) of Barbados. As assumed by PS games, the payoffs obtained by scroungers were negatively frequency dependent. Experimentally, increasing the cost of scrounging led to a decrease in the observed proportion of scroungers, whereas raising the cost of producing increased the proportion of scroungers. Observations of marked birds revealed that group-level changes could be brought about by individual flexibility in tactic use. Despite consistent individual differences in tactic use, most birds used both tactics and could alter their use of producing and scrounging when conditions changed. We found no difference in the payoffs obtained by producers and scroungers, suggesting a symmetrical game equilibrium. Our results call for testing the PS foraging game in a broader range of biological systems that include different types of scrounging behavior (e.g., scramble, stealthful, or aggressive scrounging) as well as the exploitation of different phases of food production (e.g., searching, handling).

Producer-scrounger relationships in yellow-bellied marmots	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						facultatively social; generalist; producer-scrounger; puzzle box; social foraging; yellow-bellied marmot	BEHAVIOR; DOMINANCE	When social animals forage together, they may engage in frequency-dependent strategies either as producers, those who acquire food with their own energy, or as scroungers, those who feed on what the producers discover. An individual's choice of strategy may depend on the frequency of strategies within the group, or it may depend on the individual's own traits. Most of our understanding of producer-scrounger relationships comes from highly social species, but we may gain different insights by studying less social species. We used novel puzzle box experiments to study social foraging relationships and identify the traits associated with strategy choice in facultatively social yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. We found that marmots had consistent strategies as either producers or scroungers. Furthermore, several individuals specialized as scroungers, following the producers to the puzzle box before other scroungers. However, their roles were only associated with sex (males were more likely to produce), and not with age, boldness or dominance rank. Marmots' lack of trait-regulated foraging roles may be associated with their relatively abundant and not-entirely defensible food, or may emerge from their lack of obligate social structure. We discuss how multiple factors may explain variation in social foraging behaviour. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Stable producer-scrounger dynamics in wild birds: sociability and learning speed covary with scrounging behaviour	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Parus major; producer-scrounger games; social network analysis; social learning; social foraging; animal personality	CONSISTENT INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SOCIAL-FORAGING STRATEGIES; TACTIC USE; GREAT TITS; DOMINANCE; INFORMATION; PERSONALITY; EXPLORATION; EFFICIENCY; GAMES	There has been extensive game-theoretic modelling of conditions leading to equilibria of producer-scrounger dichotomies in groups. However there is a surprising paucity of experimental evidence in wild populations. Here, we examine producer-scrounger games in five subpopulations of birds feeding at a socially learnt foraging task. Over four weeks, a bimodal distribution of producers and scroungers emerged in all areas, with pronounced and consistent individual tactic specialization persisting over 3 years. Tactics were unrelated to exploratory personality, but correlated with latency to contact and learn the foraging task, with the late arrivers and slower learners more likely to adopt the scrounging role. Additionally, the social environment was also important: at the broad scale, larger subpopulations with a higher social density contained proportionally more scroungers, while within subpopulations scroungers tended to be central in the social network and be observed in larger foraging flocks. This study thus provides a rare example of a stable, dimorphic distribution of producer-scrounger tactics in a wild population. It further gives support across multiple scales for a major prediction of social foraging theory; that the frequency of scroungers increases with group size.	[Aplin, L.

In behavioral games, what constitutes a good or bad decision about which alternative to use depends on the behavior of other individuals. Solutions to games can take the form of a stable equilibrium frequency (SEF) of alternative tactics. In this study, we ask whether individuals within flocks of ground-feeding passerines (Lonchura punctulata) engaged in a producer-scrounger game adjust their behavior and converge on the SEF by using a fixed rule of thumb or by learning to estimate payoffs by the process of responding to contingencies in reinforcements obtained from each alternative tactic. After being trained either in a high-scrounging (HS) or a low-scrounging (LS) food condition, flocks of birds were provided with identical foraging conditions over 2 successive test phases in which we expected the SEF of scrounging to decrease and then to increase. Birds trained in the HS condition scrounged more than those trained in the LS condition and continued to do so even when subsequently tested in the same conditions. This effect of past experience is inconsistent with the use of a fixed rule alone. An improvement in the efficiency of scrounging behavior within experimental phases provided further evidence of learning in this game-theoretic context. This experiment provides the first empirical evidence that group-level adjustments in scrounger use to different environmental conditions are mediated by learning the payoffs associated with each tactic.

We find that the existence and non-existence of traveling wave solutions are determined by a minimum wave speed c(m) and a threshold value R-0. By constructing a suitable invariant convex set Gamma and applying Schauder fixed point theorem, the existence for c > c(m) , R0 > 1 was established. Besides, a Lyapunov function is constructed subtly to explore the asymptotic behaviors of traveling wave solutions. The non-existences of traveling wave solutions for both c < c(m), Ro > 1 and Ro <= 1, c > 0 were obtained by two-sides Laplace transform and reduction method to absurdity.

The basic version of VRP is Capacitated VRP (CVRP) which considers equal capacities for all vehicles. The most popular way of solving CVRP is splitting the task into two different phases: firstly, assigning customers under different vehicles and secondly, finding optimal route of each vehicle. Sweep clustering algorithm is well studied for clustering customer nodes. On the other hand, route optimization is simply a traveling salesman problem (TSP) and a number of TSP optimization methods are investigated for this purpose. This study investigates a variant of Sweep algorithm for clustering nodes and Producer-Scrounger Method (PSM), the recent swarm intelligence method for TSP, for route generation to get optimal CVRP solution. In conventional Sweep algorithm, cluster formation starts from 00 and consequently advance toward 360 to consider all the nodes. In variant Sweep, cluster formation starts from a user defined angle. We have compared the outcomes of the proposed method with other related methods including recent study on a suite of benchmark CVRPs. The experimental results revealed that proposed method outperformed other methods in solving benchmark CVRPs.	[Akhand, M. A.

Producer-scrounger game models typically overlook the costs and benefits of patch exploitation, assuming instead that producers and scroungers abandon patches simultaneously once depletion occurs. Here we develop an extension of the marginal value theorem of patch exploitation that includes the producer-scrounger dynamics and examine the propensity of a producer to abandon its patch before depletion once scroungers arrive. We predict that early departures should occur more often when expected searching time decreases and when competition intensity in the patch increases. Competition intensity is expected to increase when more scroungers are present or when patches are smaller. We tested these predictions using a within-subject experimental design with six captive flocks of spice finches (Lonchura punctulata), each composed of one producer and three scroungers. As predicted, producers abandoned their food discoveries more frequently once scroungers arrived when searching time was short, when more scroungers were present, and when patches were small. The results show that the producers of a patch often leave as scroungers join their food discoveries because the payoffs from leaving exceed those from staying.

Coevolution of adaptive technology, maladaptive culture and population size in a producer-scrounger game	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						producer-scrounger game; technology; adaptation; maladaptation; individual and social learning; cyclic dynamics	ECONOMIC-GROWTH; EVOLUTION; ORIGIN	Technology (i.e. tools, methods of cultivation and domestication, systems of construction and appropriation, machines) has increased the vital rates of humans, and is one of the defining features of the transition from Malthusian ecological stagnation to a potentially perpetual rising population growth. Maladaptations, on the other hand, encompass behaviours, customs and practices that decrease the vital rates of individuals. Technology and maladaptations are part of the total stock of culture carried by the individuals in a population. Here, we develop a quantitative model for the coevolution of cumulative adaptive technology and maladaptive culture in a 'producer-scrounger' game, which can also usefully be interpreted as an 'individual-social' learner interaction. Producers (individual learners) are assumed to invent new adaptations and maladaptations by trial-and-error learning, insight or deduction, and they pay the cost of innovation. Scroungers (social learners) are assumed to copy or imitate (cultural transmission) both the adaptations and maladaptations generated by producers. We show that the coevolutionary dynamics of producers and scroungers in the presence of cultural transmission can have a variety of effects on population carrying capacity. From stable polymorphism, where scroungers bring an advantage to the population (increase in carrying capacity), to periodic cycling, where scroungers decrease carrying capacity, we find that selection-driven cultural innovation and transmission may send a population on the path of indefinite growth or to extinction.

SPATIAL POPULATION DYNAMICS IN A PRODUCER-SCROUNGER MODEL	DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS-SERIES B			English	Article						Producer-scrounger; scramble kleptoparasitism; spatial ecology; population dynamics; reaction-diffusion	EIGENVALUE PROBLEM; GAME-THEORY; EVOLUTION; KLEPTOPARASITISM; EQUATIONS; ENVIRONMENTS; DISPERSAL; EXISTENCE; FORAGERS; MOVEMENT	The spatial population dynamics of an ecological system involving producers and scroungers is studied using a reaction-diffusion model. The two populations move randomly and increase logistically, with birth rates determined by the amount of resource acquired. Producers can obtain the resource directly from the environment, but must surrender a proportion of their discoveries to nearby scroungers through a process known as scramble kleptoparasitism. The proportion of resources stolen by a scrounger from nearby producers decreases as the local scrounger density increases. Parameter combinations which allow producers and scroungers to persist either alone or together are distinguished from those in which they cannot. Producer persistence depends in general on the distribution of resources and producer movement, whereas scrounger persistence depends on its ability to invade when producers are at steady-state. It is found that (i) both species can persist when the habitat has high productivity, (ii) neither species can persist when the habitat has low productivity, and (iii) slower dispersal of both the producer and scrounger is favored when the habitat has intermediate productivity.

Producer-scrounger roles and joining based on dominance in a free-living group of Mexican jays (Aphelocoma ultramarina)	BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						producer-scrounger; Mexican jay; Aphelocoma ultramarina; group foraging	FORAGING TACTICS; ZEBRA FINCHES; FLOCKS; FOOD; BEHAVIOR; SUCCESS	While foraging, animals often exploit group members to obtain food. One way to describe this behaviour is with the producer-scrounger (PS) model, where scroungers use social interaction to obtain food discovered by producers. Mexican jays (Aphelocoma ultramarina) are a group-foraging species with a linear dominance hierarchy. We studied interactions in a free-living foraging group to determine (1) if foraging interactions can be explained with the PS model, (2) if these roles are consistent and (3) if dominance or relatedness affects joining frequency. We recorded board-flipping, eating, and joining events during sets of feeding trials. We show that Mexican jays use PS roles and that these roles were consistent through many trials, but might have changed between trial sets. Relatedness and frequency of joining were not correlated. Dominance influenced joining in that joining was more likely to occur between birds with a larger difference in their dominance rank. In contrast to other studies, our results suggest that this effect is mediated through joiner preference. Scroungers preferentially joined birds of lower dominance rank and high search activity. Producers with these qualities had fewer eating events with full access to seeds, suggesting that scrounging exacts a cost on producers.

One such situation involves cases where an animal can search for a new resource (produce) or join what others have already found (scrounge). A number of game-theoretic models have been proposed to predict the equilibrium combination of producer and scrounger strategists based on the evolutionarily stable strategy. However, each game model can only handle a few environmental parameters at a time and none address the flexible use of tactics that allows individuals to respond quickly and adaptively to changes in payoffs. In this study we propose an agent-based model using a linear operator learning rule as the decision mechanism. The model provides a unified framework from which to predict the effects on the expected equilibrium of producers and scroungers of group size, metabolic requirement, finder's advantage, food intake rate, cost of searching, cost of joining, patch encounter probability and patch richness. The simulation results replicate almost every producer-scrounger prediction and experimental result published to date such that the simulation provides a more general tool than any single game-theoretic model to predict behaviour under frequency-dependent conditions. The model furthermore allows us to develop a novel prediction about foraging behaviour in a more realistic environment of variable patch richness. By modelling the operation of a plausible decision rule, we can explore the validity of the behavioural gambit, the assumption that the unspecified decision mechanisms of game-theoretic models faithfully reproduce outcomes expected of natural selection operating over generations on fixed alternatives. We suggest that this simulation model can provide a tool for others to explore and predict the effect of more complex and hence realistic foraging conditions on individual levels of producer and scrounger use.

In the proposed method, the swarm is divided into three parts: the producer, scroungers and remainders. The producer is the best individual selected from current population and it exploits the new solution with a random angle and a maximal radius. Some individuals, which are different from the producer, are randomly selected according to a predefined probability as scroungers. The scroungers update their position with an area-copying operator, which is used in the PS model. The remainders are updated by means of teaching and learning operators as they are used in the TLBO algorithm. In each iteration, the computation cost of the proposed algorithm is less than that of the original TLBO algorithm, because the individuals of the PS model are only evaluated once and the individuals of the TLBO algorithm are evaluated two times in each iteration. The proposed algorithm is tested on different kinds of benchmark problems, and the results indicate that the proposed algorithm has competitive performance to some other algorithms in terms of accuracy, convergence speed and success rate.

However, individual differences in social contexts have received less attention. We explored the consistency and temporal persistence of individual differences in tactic use in a producer-scrounger foraging game using two sets of flocks of wild-caught nutmeg mannikins, Lonchura punctulata. With both sets of birds, we observed significant individual differences in tactic use that persisted under different food distributions and when flock members were reunited at a 6-month interval with the same flockmates but not when flock members were different. In another experiment, in which birds with high-scrounging profiles were made to forage in the same flock, the corporate frequency of scrounging was no higher, and the intake rate no lower than in flocks made up of intermediate- or low-frequency scroungers. Taken together our experiments suggest that persistent individual differences can arise from dynamics that are peculiar to the group in which they occur, underlining the importance of companions' identity in determining tactic use in this game. Behavioural plasticity can erase idiosyncratic individual differences in games with frequency-dependent payoffs when group composition changes.

However, the empirical testing of such models has generally been restricted to indoor aviary experiments. Here, we examine the social foraging tactics of naturally foraging wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). Thirty-six adult baboons from 2 groups were observed during full-day follows: Data from nearly 10 000 foraging events were analyzed using cross-classified, generalized linear mixed models. First, as predicted by producer-scrounger models, we show that baboons altered their foraging tactics in accordance with food patch size and spatial position in the group. Second, we show that the relative characteristics of cofeeding individuals were crucial: In particular, among females, individuals were more likely to scrounge from foraging neighbors who were subordinate and with whom they had a strong social affiliation. However, we found no effect of kinship. Finally, we found that female reproductive state influenced female foraging tactics (females scrounged more from male neighbors when pregnant and less when fertile), but the reproductive state of female neighbors had no such effects on male foraging tactics. These results suggest that, in addition to broad-scale ecological and group-level influences, a myriad of social and reproductive factors can shape producer-scrounger dynamics for wild animals living in complex social groups.

J	Ohtsuka, Y; Toquenaga, Y				Ohtsuka, Yasunori; Toquenaga, Yukihiko			The patch distributed producer-scrounger game	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Information-parasitism; Group foraging; Animal aggregation; Evolutionarily stable strategy; Horn's model	INFORMATION-CENTERS	Grouping in animals is ubiquitous and thought to provide group members antipredatory advantages and foraging efficiency. However, parasitic foraging strategy often emerges in a group. The optimal parasitic policy has given rise to the producer-scrounger (PS) game model, in which producers search for food patches, and scroungers parasitize the discovered patches. The N-persons PS game model constructed by Vickery et al. (1991. Producers, scroungers, and group foraging. American Naturalist 137, 847-863) predicts the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) of frequency of producers ((q) over cap) that depends on the advantage of producers and the number of foragers in a group. However, the model assumes that the number of discovered patches in one time unit never exceeds one. In reality, multiple patches could be found in one time unit. In the present study, we relax this assumption and assumed that the number of discovered patches depends on the producers' variable encounter rate with patches (lambda). We show that (q) over cap strongly depends on lambda within a feasible range, although it still depends on the advantage of producer and the number of foragers in a group. The basic idea of PS game is the same as the information sharing (parasitism), because scroungers are also thought to parasitize informations of locations of food patches. Horn (1968) indicated the role of information-parasitism in animal aggregation (Horn, H. S., 1968. The adaptive significance of colonial nesting in the Brewer's blackbird (euphagus cyanocephalus). Ecology 49, 682-646). Our modified PS game model shows the same prediction as the Horn's graphical animal aggregation model; the proportion of scroungers will increase or animals should adopt colonial foraging when resource is spatiotemporally clumped, but scroungers will decrease or animals should adopt territorial foraging if there source is evenly distributed.

Bats are among the most social mammals, often living in colonies of tens to thousands of individuals for dozens of years, yet little is known about their social foraging dynamics. We observed three captive bat colonies for over a year, quantifying > 13,000 social foraging interactions. We found that individuals consistently used one of two foraging strategies, either producing (collecting) food themselves or scrounging it directly from the mouth of other individuals. Individual foraging types were consistent over at least 16 months except during the lactation period when females shifted toward producing. Scroungers intentionally selected whom to interact with when socially foraging, thus generating persistent nonrandom social relationships with two to three specific producers. These persistent producer-scrounger relationships seem to reduce aggression over time. Finally, scrounging was highly correlated with vigilance, and we hypothesize that vigilant-prone individuals turn to scrounging in the wild to mitigate the risk of landing on a potentially unsafe fruit tree. We find the bat colony to be a rich and dynamic social system, which can serve as a model to study the role that social foraging plays in the evolution of mammalian sociality. Our results highlight the importance of considering individual tendencies when exploring social behavior patterns of group-living animals. These tendencies further emphasize the necessity of studying social networks over time.

Cognition and covariance in the producer-scrounger game	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						alternative tactics; field experiment; individual differences; learning; repeatability; social foraging	CULTURAL TRANSMISSION; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; CAPTIVE FLOCKS; BEHAVIOR; WILD; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; FLEXIBILITY; INHIBITION; FORAGERS	The producer-scrounger game is a key element of foraging ecology in many systems. Producing and scrounging typically covary negatively, but partitioning this covariance into contributions of individual plasticity and consistent between individual differences is key to understanding population-level consequences of foraging strategies. Furthermore, little is known about the role cognition plays in the producer-scrounger game. We investigated the role of cognition in these alternative foraging tactics in wild mixed-species flocks of great tits and blue tits, using a production learning task in which we measured individuals' speed of learning to visit the single feeder in an array that would provide them with a food reward. We also quantified the proportion of individuals' feeds that were scrounges ('proportion scrounged'); scrounging was possible if individuals visited immediately after a previous rewarded visitor. Three learning experiments-initial and two reversal learning-enabled us to estimate the repeatability and covariance of each foraging behaviour. First, we examined whether individuals learned to improve their scrounging success (i.e. whether they obtained food by scrounging when there was an opportunity to do so). Second, we quantified the repeatability of proportion scrounged, and asked whether proportion scrounged affected production learning speed among individuals. Third, we used multivariate analyses to partition within- and among-individual components of covariance between proportion scrounged and production learning speed. Individuals improved their scrounging success over time. Birds with a greater proportion scrounged took longer to learn their own rewarding feeder. Although multivariate analyses showed that covariance between proportion scrounged and learning speed was driven primarily by within-individual variation, that is, by behavioural plasticity, among-individual differences also played a role for blue tits. This is the first demonstration of a cognitive trait influencing producing and scrounging in the same wild system, highlighting the importance of cognition in the use of alternative resource acquisition tactics. The results of our covariance analyses suggest the potential for genetic differences in allocation to alternative foraging tactics, which are likely species- and system-dependent. They also point to the need to control for different foraging tactics when studying individual cognition in the wild.

J	Mottley, K; Giraldeau, LA				Mottley, K; Giraldeau, LA			Experimental evidence that group foragers can converge on predicted producer-scrounger equilibria	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							CAPTIVE FLOCKS; SPICE FINCHES; GAME; ENVIRONMENT; BEHAVIOR	When foraging together, animals are often observed to feed from food discoveries of others. The producer-scrounger (PS) game predicts how frequently this phenomenon of food parasitism should occur. The game assumes: (1) at any moment all individuals can unambiguously be categorized as either playing producer (searching for undiscovered food resources) or scrounger (searching for exploitation opportunities), and (2) the payoffs received from the scrounger tactic are negatively frequency dependent; a scrounger does better than a producer when the scrounger tactic is rare, but worse when it is common. No study to date has shown that the payoffs of producer and scrounger conform to the game's assumptions or that groups of foragers reach the predicted stable equilibrium frequency (SEF) of scrounger, whereby both tactics obtain the same payoff. The current study of three captive flocks of spice finches, Lonchura punctulata, provides the first test of the PS game using an apparatus in which both assumptions of the PS game are met. The payoffs to the scrounger, measured as feeding rate (seeds/s), were highly negatively frequency dependent on the frequency of scrounger. The feeding rate for scrounger declined linearly while the rate for producer either declined only slightly or not at all with increasing scrounger frequency. When given the opportunity to alternate between tactics, the birds changed their use of each, such that the group converged on the predicted SEF of scrounger after 5-8 days of testing. Individuals in this study, therefore, demonstrated sufficient plasticity in tactic use such that the flock foraged at the SEF of scrounger. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

To maximize food returns, producers should distance themselves from potential competitors whereas scroungers should increase proximity to potential producers. We investigated the extent to which playing one or the other tactic affected an individual's location in captive flocks of ground-feeding spice finches (Lonchura punctulata) as they foraged for hidden clumps of food on an aviary floor. We constrained some individuals to use the producer tactic by pre-training them to find food hidden under lids. Constrained producers foraged significantly further from the center of flocks than constrained scroungers. Flocks with many scroungers were significantly more compact than flocks with fewer scroungers. The results are consistent with published simulations of spatially explicit producer-scrounger models and suggest that the use of producer and scrounger foraging tactics be included as a factor that affects an individual's position within foraging groups.

The foraging benefits of group living include increased efficiency and reduced need for vigilance, but social foraging can also encourage theft of captured prey from conspecifics. The payoffs of stealing prey from others (scrounging) versus capturing prey (producing) may depend not only on the frequency of each foraging strategy in the group but also on an individual's ability to steal. By observing the foraging behavior of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), we found that, within a group, relatively smaller coho acted primarily as producers and took longer to handle prey, and were therefore more likely to be targeted by scroungers than relatively larger coho. Further, our observations suggest that the frequency of scrounging may be higher when groups contained individuals of different sizes. Based on these observations, we developed a model of phenotype-limited producer-scrounger dynamics, in which rates of stealing were structured by the relative size of producers and scroungers within the foraging group. Model simulations show that when the success of stealing is positively related to body size, relatively large predators should tend to be scroungers while smaller predators should be producers. Contrary to previous models, we also found that, under certain conditions, producer and scrounger strategies could coexist for both large and small phenotypes. Large scroungers tended to receive the highest payoff, suggesting that producer-scrounger dynamics may result in an uneven distribution of benefits among group members thatunder the right conditionscould entrench social positions of dominance.

Indeed, personality shows heritable variation and has been linked to fitness in many species. However, the fitness effects of personality are highly variable within and between species. Furthermore, the nature of the causal influence of personality on an organism's fitness remains unclear so far. Competition has been proposed as a factor modulating this relationship. Thus, personality has been found to affect individual success in competition by interference in a few species, but its influence in scramble competition remains unexplored. We assessed exploratory tendencies (thought to be a key component of personality) in a model species, the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. In a first session, we formed foraging flocks composed of four individuals with different exploration scores, and allowed them to play producer-scrounger games repeatedly. During a second session, individuals were reassigned to different flocks to check for consistency in the influence of exploratory tendency across different social contexts. Exploratory tendency influenced individual feeding success during the first session but not during the second one. High-exploratory birds were less successful at finding food (i.e. playing the producer tactic) and consequently had a lower feeding success, but were presumably able to adjust their behaviour between sessions. We discuss our results in relation to the interactive effects of both personality and experience, and highlight the role of competition processes on the evolution of personality.

J	Barta, Z; Giraldeau, LA				Barta, Z; Giraldeau, LA			Daily patterns of optimal producer and scrounger use under predation hazard: A state-dependent dynamic game analysis	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						social foraging; producer-scrounger game; state-dependent dynamic game	FORAGING SUCCESS; CAPTIVE FLOCKS; JUNCO-HYEMALIS; DAILY ROUTINES; GROUP-SIZE; BEHAVIOR; RISK; DOMINANCE; ENVIRONMENT; STRATEGIES	Feeding in groups often gives rise to joining: feeding From other's discoveries. The joining decision has been modeled as a producer-scrounger game where the producer strategy consists of searching for one's food and the scrounger strategy consists of searching for food discovered by others. Previous models revealed that the evolutionarily stable proportion of scrounging mostly depends on the fraction of each food patch available only to its producer. These early models are static and state independent and are therefore unable to explore whether the time of day, the animal's state, and the degree of predation hazard influence an individual's decision of whether to use the producer or scrounger strategy. To investigate these issues, we developed a state-dependent dynamic producer-scrounger game model. The model predicts that, early in the day, low reserves promote a preference for the scrounger strategy, while the same condition late in the day favors the use of the producer strategy. Under rich and clumped food, the availability of scrounging can improve the daily survival of any average group member. The model suggests only weak effects of predation hazard on the use of scrounging. Future developments should consider the effects of dominance asymmetries and allowing foragers a choice between foraging alone or in a group harboring an evolutionarily stable Frequency of scrounger.

Individuals can either search for food sources themselves (producing) or they can join food discoveries of others (scrounging). In this study we use a genetic algorithm in a spatially explicit producer-scrounger game to explore how individuals compromise between exploration (an important axis of animal personality) and scrounging and how characteristics of the environment affect this compromise. Agents varied in exploration and scrounging and a genetic algorithm searched for the optimal combination of exploration and scrounging. The foraging environments featured different levels of patch richness, predation and patch density. Our simulations show that under conditions of low patch densities slow exploring scroungers were favored whereas high patch density favored fast exploring individuals that either produced (at low patch richness) or scrounged (at high patch richness). In high predation environments fast exploring individuals were selected for but only at low to intermediate patch densities. Predation did not affect scrounging behavior. We did not find a divergence of exploration 'types' within a given environment, but there was a general association between exploration and scrounging across different environments: high rates of scrounging were observed over nearly the full spectrum of exploration values, whereas high rates of producing were only observed at high exploration values, suggesting that cases in which slow explorers start producing should be rare. Our results indicate that the spatial arrangement of food resources can affect the optimal social attraction rules between agents, the optimality of foraging tactic and the interaction between both.

The use of producer and scrounger strategies has been modelled as an alternative-option scramble which assumes strong negative frequency-dependence of the scrounger's pay-offs. We tested this assumption in a flock feeding situation by manipulating the proportion of scroungers in flocks of spice finches, Lonchura punctulata. In a first experiment we found that: (1) the food intake of scroungers, and to a lesser extent producers, was negatively affected by an increase in the proportion of scroungers; (2) the food intake of producers and scroungers was equal when the proportion of scroungers was small, suggesting that producers, who exploited 35.4% of their patches by scrounging were opportunistically adjusting their use of the strategies until the pay-offs equalized. In a second experiment we tested whether finches could vary their use of the two strategies in response to changes in foraging conditions brought about by an increase in the cost of producing. As predicted by the game, finches reduced their use of the producer strategy and increased their use of the scrounger strategy when the cost of producing increased. These results suggest that spice finches can alter their allocation to each foraging alternative by experience and that the producer-scrounger game is a realistic model for predicting group foraging decisions.

Previous experimental inquiries have demonstrated that individuals vary in their tendency to play either tactic but the extent to which individual factors influence variation in foraging behavior are little studied. In the present study, we have assessed the influence of natural variation in body condition on the differential use of social foraging tactics and their resulting payoffs in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). The producer tactic was found to yield more consistent and predictable rewards across trials than the scrounger tactic. The use of producer was related to reduced variation in food intake and an increased amount of food consumed. We found that poor-condition birds were more likely to produce and so consumed more seeds than good-condition birds. The results are consistent with theoretical models of variance-sensitive social foraging but suggest that scrounging may not represent a variance-averse option in all situations. We propose that in a producer-scrounger context, the variance-averse option may depend on group size and food clumping. Finally, we discuss our results in relation to interindividual differences in metabolism and behavior.

J	Koops, MA; Giraldeau, LA				Koops, MA; Giraldeau, LA			Producer-scrounger foraging games in starlings: A test of rate-maximizing and risk-sensitive models	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							ENVIRONMENT; STRATEGIES; DOMINANCE; FLOCKING; BEHAVIOR; SUCCESS	Social foragers obtain food through two tactics: 'producer' searches for its food, and 'scrounger' exploits food discovered by producer. In the recent literature, two alternative producer-scrounger (P-S) models have been proposed, one rate-maximizing, the other risk-sensitive. Their predictions differ about the effect of food clump density on the equilibrium proportional use of scrounger in a group. The rate-maximizing model predicts no effect, whereas the risk-sensitive model predicts that the proportional use of scrounger should increase with food clump density. These predictions were tested using wild-caught European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, in an indoor aviary. Increased food clump density resulted in significant increases in the proportional use of scrounger. Proportional use of scrounger was negatively related to food intake variance as assumed by the risk-sensitive model. Thus, scrounger is a risk-averse foraging tactic, and starlings used it in a risk-sensitive fashion. The risk-sensitive model was further challenged by testing its prediction concerning daily food requirement. When producer has a low competitive efficiency, as was found in these starlings, the risk-sensitive model predicts weakly positive effects, if any, of increased requirement on proportional use of scrounger. Results were consistent with this prediction. A significant number of starlings showed consistently positive effects of requirement on proportional use of scrounger, but the magnitude of this increase was non-significant. The results of both experiments taken together show that the proportional use of scrounger tactics within foraging groups may be a risk-sensitive, rather than a rate-maximizing, foraging tactic.

J	Beauchamp, G				Beauchamp, G			Learning rules for social foragers: Implications for the producer-scrounger game and ideal free distribution theory	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							PATCHY ENVIRONMENT; INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS; PREDATORS; EXPLOITATION; INFORMATION; MODEL; TIME	In population games, the optimal behaviour of a forager depends partly on courses of action selected by other individuals in the population. How individuals learn to allocate effort in foraging games involving frequency-dependent payoffs has been little examined. The performance of three different learning rules was investigated in several types of habitats in each of two population games. Learning rules allow individuals to weigh information about the past and the present and to choose among alternative patterns of behaviour. In the producer-scrounger game, foragers use producer to locate food patches and scrounger to exploit the food discoveries of others. In the ideal free distribution game, foragers that experience feeding interference from companions distribute themselves among heterogeneous food patches. In simulations of each population game, the use of different learning rules induced large variation in foraging behaviour, thus providing a tool to assess the relevance of each learning rule in experimental systems. Rare mutants using alternative learning rules often successfully invaded populations of foragers using other rules indicating that some learning rules are not stable when pitted against each other. Learning rules often closely approximated optimal behaviour in each population game suggesting that stimulus-response learning of contingencies created by foraging companions could be sufficient to perform at near-optimal level in two population games.

J	Coolen, I				Coolen, I			Increasing foraging group size increases scrounger use and reduces searching efficiency in nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura punctulata)	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						group size; nutmeg mannikins; producer-scrounger; searching efficiency; social foraging	CAPTIVE FLOCKS; HOUSE SPARROWS; SPICE FINCHES; PRODUCER; INTERFERENCE; ENVIRONMENT; BEHAVIOR; PATCHES; VIGILANCE; GEOMETRY	Social foragers can benefit from others' success by joining and sharing their food discoveries. In a producer-scrounger (PS) system, foragers can either search for food themselves (play producer) or search for joining opportunities (play scrounger), but not both at the same time. Empirical evidence is accumulating to show that the joining decision of ground-feeding birds like nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura punctulata) can be modeled by a PS game. However some predictions remain to be tested. For instance, foragers are predicted to increase their use of the scrounger tactic as group size increases. Also, one consequence of the incompatibility between producer and scrounger tactics is that the per capita searching efficiency should decrease as the use of scrounger increases. I tested these predictions in an indoor aviary using four flocks of nutmeg mannikins. I manipulated the stable equilibrium frequency (SEF) of the scrounger tactic by varying group size and the finder's share. As predicted by PS games, birds increased their use of scrounger as group size increased. Also, the per capita interval between patch discoveries increased and the per capita finding rate decreased as conditions called for a higher SEF of scrounger. I discuss why the decreased searching efficiency observed likely follows from the incompatibility between producer and scrounger tactics rather than from artifacts of the conditions used or from any form of interference.

J	Barta, Z; Giraldeau, LA				Barta, Z; Giraldeau, LA			Breeding colonies as information centers: a reappraisal of information-based hypotheses using the producer-scrounger game	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article							EVOLUTION; RECRUITMENT; STRATEGIES; ADVANTAGES; SELECTION; PATTERNS	One of the most cited hypotheses for the evolutionary advantages of colonial breeding proposes that colonies serve as a place of information exchange about the location of food-the information center hypothesis. Despite its popularity, the hypothesis generated considerable controversy over its predictions and role in the evolution of colonial breeding. As a consequence, the hypothesis still lingers on, despite numerous apparent falsifcations from both observational and experimental approaches. The controversy has three roots: the unclear causal direction between coloniality and information center, the unrecognized distinction between colonial breeding and colonial roosting, and the use of an implicit group selectionist argument. Here we try to clarify this controversy by applying an entirely individual selection-based approach, the producer-scrounger game, to the information center hypothesis. Furthermore, we show how other information-based alternatives of the original information center hypothesis (e.g., local enhancement and recruitment center hypotheses) can be included in a common framework. Our model predicts that individuals relying on information transfer at die colony should be rather common in nature. This prediction is essentially unaltered by the inclusion of either local enhancement or recruitment center. On the other hand, the frequency of leading unknowledgeable: individuals (the most accepted sign of information center) is expected to be very low. The model indicates that tests of information-based hypotheses should focus on the expected relative frequency of food-searching flights rather than the frequency of leading.

Tactic use in producer-scrounger games is partly flexible but individuals tend to show consistency in tactic use under different conditions suggesting that personality might play a role in tactic use in producer-scrounger games. Here we studied the use of producing and scrounging tactics by bold and shy barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis), where boldness is a personality trait known to be repeatable over time in this species. We defined individuals as bold, shy or intermediate based on two novel object tests. We scored the frequency of finding food patches (the outcome of investing in producing) and joining patches (the outcome of investing in scrounging) by bold and shy individuals and their feeding time. Shy individuals had a higher frequency of joining than bold individuals, demonstrating for the first time that personality is associated with tactic use in a producer-scrounger game. Bold individuals tended to spend more time feeding than shy individuals. Our results highlight the importance of including individual behavioural variation in models of producer-scrounger games.

Relying on a recent mathematical model, we here test the prediction that the emergence of differences in within-individual consistency is related to the sequential access to resources in a frequency-dependent foraging game. To this end we used flocks of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) engaged in a producer-scrounger foraging game. Tactic investment (i.e., the proportion of hops with the head down) significantly predicted successful tactic use (i.e., the proportion of seeds produced). In support of predictions, we found that individuals that arrived first at a foraging area were more consistent in both their investment into and their use of the producer tactic. Also, birds in higher body condition were less consistent in their producer tactic use. These results provide the first evidence that variation in behavioral consistency can emerge through the sequential access to resources in a frequency-dependent game. They also highlight a potential physiological cost of behavioral flexibility. Our findings suggest an explanation for the link between personality traits and social information use.

If searching for food and searching for exploitation opportunities within a group are mutually exclusive alternatives, the decision to use one or the other is modeled as a producer-scrounger game because the value of each alternative is frequency dependent. Stochastic producer-scrounger models generally assume that producer provides a more variable and uncertain reward than does the scrounger and hence is a riskier foraging alternative. Socially foraging animals that are attempting to reduce their risk of starvation should therefore alter their use of producer and scrounger alternatives in response to changes in energy budget. We observed flocks of nutmeg mannikins (L. punctulata) foraging in an indoor aviary to determine whether their use of producer and scrounger alternatives were risk sensitive. Analyses of the foraging rewards of three flocks of seven birds confirm that producer is a riskier foraging strategy than is scrounger, although the difference in risk is rather small. We then submitted two other flocks to two different energy budgets and observed the foraging decision of four focal birds in each flock. All but one bird increased their relative use of the riskier producer strategy in the low food reserve treatment, but the overall use of producer did not differ significantly between treatments, providing evidence for a small but consistent effect.

While these alternative behaviours are well documented, it is not clear to what extent an individual's tendency to forage independently or to follow others is under genetic control or rather is affected by experience. To examine whether hand-reared juveniles can learn to prefer using a producer or a scrounger tactic, we hand-reared house sparrow, Passer domesticus, nestlings that upon. edging were assigned to one of two training groups; the first was expected to enhance joining ( scrounging) behaviour and the second to enhance searching ( producing) behaviour. In the first group, fledglings were imprinted on a parent model ( stuffed female sparrow) that visited locations containing food. In the second group,fledglings were imprinted on a parent model that visited locations containing no food, while food was available in different locations. At the end of a 5-day training phase, all fledglings were released into a shared aviary, and their social foraging tendencies were measured. We found that fledglings from the first group used significantly more joining behaviour than fledglings from the second group, suggesting that an individual whose early experience positively reinforced joining behaviour is more likely to later become a joiner. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence for the effect of learning on the choice between social foraging strategies in the context of the producere scrounger game.

Participants designed "virtual arrowheads" and tested them in "virtual hunting environments", improving their designs through either individual trial-and-error learning or by copying the design of another participant. A previous study using this task [Mesoudi, A., & O'Brien, M. J. (2008). The cultural transmission of Great Basin projectile point technology 1: An experimental simulation. American Antiquity, 73, 3-28.] found that a cultural learning strategy Of "copy-successful-individuals" was significantly more adaptive than individual learning. The present study explored the robustness of this finding using the same task but under different conditions. It was found that (a) individual learning was significantly more adaptive in a unimodal adaptive landscape than in a multimodal adaptive landscape, suggesting that the adaptive advantage of cultural learning would disappear in unimodal environments; (b) the adaptive advantage of copy-successful-individuals was maintained when cultural learning was permitted at regular intervals. despite the increased opportunity for information scroungers to inhibit exploration of the environment, because participants flexibly switched between individual and cultural learning depending on circumstances; (c) allowing participants to set access costs that other participants must pay in order to view their designs severely curtailed the use of cultural learning and especially the copy-successful-individuals strategy.

Since individual differences in learning ability could be a source of differences in behavioural plasticity, the frequency dependence of payoffs within a foraging group may permit the coexistence of both plastic, fast-learning individuals and nonplastic, slow-learning individuals; in a frequency-dependent context the adjustments of a few benefit all. In this study, we investigated whether individuals that learned faster in a simple associative learning task were also more likely to adjust their behaviour in a social foraging game context than their slower-learning groupmates. We measured the associative learning ability of female Bengalese finches, Lonchura striata domestica, in a colour discrimination task and their degree of behavioural plasticity in tactic use when foraging conditions called for changes in the flock's producer-scrounger equilibrium. We found that behavioural plasticity was affected by learning speed. However, in contrast to our expectation, the slower learners were most plastic. We argue that behavioural plasticity in the producer-scrounger game context may require learning that is different from colour matching. We also propose that our results may be related to the fast-slow continuum; being proactive or fast and inaccurate could favour being responsive in simple asocial contexts while being reactive or slow and accurate could favour being plastic in more complex social contexts. Future empirical studies need to compare differences in behavioural plasticity in tactic use with learning speed measured in other types of learning tasks and with personality traits relevant to the fast-slow continuum.

While experimental evidence in the producer-scrounger game suggests that learned strategy choice may be common, a recent theoretical analysis demonstrated that learning by only some individuals prevents learning from evolving in others. Here, however, we model learning explicitly, and demonstrate that learning can easily evolve in the whole population. We used an agent-based evolutionary simulation of the producer-scrounger game to test the success of two general learning rules for strategy choice. We found that learning was eventually acquired by all individuals under a sufficient degree of environmental fluctuation, and when players were phenotypically asymmetric. In the absence of sufficient environmental change or phenotypic asymmetries, the correct target for learning seems to be confounded by game dynamics, and innate strategy choice is likely to be fixed in the population. The results demonstrate that under biologically plausible conditions, learning can easily evolve in the whole population and that phenotypic asymmetry is important for the evolution of learned strategy choice, especially in a stable or mildly changing environment.

For both, small and large groups, the number of production opportunities per capita was equal. Foraging strategies were classified as either production (opening gates with food) or scrounging (following conspecifics). Small groups showed a higher proportion of producers than large groups and required less time to deplete the food. The proportion of producing and scrounging responses yields to equilibrium between their payoffs. Producing and scrounging were highly correlated with different prior responses. Also, the relative frequency of producing and scrounging associated activities correlated with the time spent consuming food procured by each activity. It is possible that a simple outcome-strategy feedback mechanism mediates the choice of prior activities and procurement responses.

We tested whether group formation by a kleptoparasitic fish, the western buffalo bream (Kyphosus cornelii), fit the predictions of five social foraging models. Two aggregation economy models assumed that there was some benefit to grouping shared by group members, such as reduced predation risk or increased ability to gain access to resources. These models and a third, the dispersion (ideal free) economy model, assumed that kleptoparasites had perfect information regarding the quality of opportunities for kleptoparasitism. The other two models did not make this assumption. These producer-scrounger models assumed that some kleptoparasites (producers) discovered opportunities, while others used producers to reduce the costs of foraging. These last two models differed in whether foragers could estimate the state of current opportunities for kleptoparasitism. We compared typical group size, and the influence of group size on intake rate and the success of kleptoparasitic attempts, with the predictions of these models. We found that typical group size was larger during periods. when opportunities for kleptoparasitism were poor than when good and that there was no influence of group size on the likelihood that the group was successful at kleptoparasitizing. Individual intake rate declined with group size for small group sizes, but increased with group size in large groups. However, large groups were rare. For small groups, only a producer-scrounger model allowing foragers to update their information could not be rejected. For large groups, neither that model nor the aggregation economy with foraging benefits model could be rejected. We compare these results with those of other studies of kleptoparasitic groups.

This resource can be food or a territory, and in some situations, potentially divisible. In a previous paper we considered a producer and scrounger competing for an indivisible resource, where each individual could choose the level of energy that they would invest in the contest. The higher the investment, the higher the probability of success, but also the higher the costs incurred in the contest. In that paper decisions were sequential with the scrounger choosing their strategy before the producer. In this paper we consider a version of the game where decisions are made simultaneously. For the same cost functions as before, we analyse this case in detail, and then make comparisons between the two cases. Finally we discuss some real examples with potentially variable and asymmetric energetic investments, including intraspecific contests amongst spiders and amongst parasitoid wasps. In the case of the spiders, detailed estimates of energetic expenditure are available which demonstrate the asymmetric values assumed in our models. For the wasps the value of the resource can affect the probabilities of success of the defender and attacker, and differential energetic investment can be inferred. In general for real populations energy usage varies markedly depending upon crucial parameters extrinsic to the individual such as resource value and intrinsic ones such as age, and is thus an important factor to consider when modelling.

J	Barta, Z; Giraldeau, LA				Barta, Z; Giraldeau, LA			The effect of dominance hierarchy on the use of alternative foraging tactics: A phenotype-limited producing-scrounging game	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						dominance hierarchy; game theory; group foraging; phenotype limitation; producer-scrounger	CONVICT CICHLIDS; CAPTIVE FLOCKS; JUNCO-HYEMALIS; GROUP-SIZE; FOOD; SPARROWS; BEHAVIOR; MONOPOLIZATION; LOCATIONS; STRATEGY	Group living is thought to be advantageous for animals, though it also creates opportunities for exploitation. Using food discovered by others can be described as a producer-scrounger, frequency-dependent game. In the game, scroungers (parasitic individuals) do better than producers (food finders) when scroungers are rare in the group, but they do worse when scroungers are common. When the individuals' payoffs do not depend on their phenotype (i.e. a symmetric game), this strong negative frequency dependence leads to a mixed stable solution where both alternatives obtain equal payoffs. Here, we address the question of how differences in social status in a dominance hierarchy influence the individuals' decision to play producer or scrounger in small foraging groups. We model explicitly the food intake rate of each individual in a dominance-structured foraging group, then calculate the Nash equilibrium for them. Our model predicts that only strong differences in competitive ability will influence the use of producing or scrounging tactics in small foraging groups; dominants will mainly play scrounger and subordinates will mostly use producer. Since the differences in competitive ability of different-ranking individuals likely depend on the economic defendability of food, our model provides a step towards the integration of social foraging and resource defence theories.

J	Dubois, F; Morand-Ferron, J; Giraldeau, LA				Dubois, Frederique; Morand-Ferron, Julie; Giraldeau, Luc-Alain			Learning in a game context: strategy choice by some keeps learning from evolving in others	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						learning; polymorphism; frequency dependence; producer-scrounger game; personality; behavioural syndrome	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EXPLORATORY-BEHAVIOR; EVOLUTION; RULES; FOOD; PERSONALITY; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; BOLDNESS	Behavioural decisions in a social context commonly have frequency-dependent outcomes and so require analysis using evolutionary game theory. Learning provides a mechanism for tracking changing conditions and it has frequently been predicted to supplant fixed behaviour in shifting environments; yet few studies have examined the evolution of learning specifically in a game-theoretic context. We present a model that examines the evolution of learning in a frequency-dependent context created by a producer-scrounger game, where producers search for their own resources and scroungers usurp the discoveries of producers. We ask whether a learning mutant that can optimize its use of producer and scrounger to local conditions can invade a population of non-learning individuals that play producer and scrounger with fixed probabilities. We find that learning provides an initial advantage but never evolves to fixation. Once a stable equilibrium is attained, the population is always made up of a majority of fixed players and a minority of learning individuals. This result is robust to variation in the initial proportion of fixed individuals, the rate of within-and between-generation environmental change, and population size. Such learning polymorphisms will manifest themselves in a wide range of contexts, providing an important element leading to behavioural syndromes.

Dominance, pair bonds and boldness determine social-foraging tactics in rooks, Corvus frugilegus	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						boldness; Corvus frugilegus; dominance; individual differences; heterogeneity; pair bond; personality; producer-scrounger; rook; social foraging	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; HAEMATOPUS-OSTRALEGUS; SCROUNGING BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS; ENERGY RESERVES; CAPTIVE FLOCKS; ZEBRA FINCHES; PRODUCER; PERSONALITY; KLEPTOPARASITISM	Socially foraging animals can search for resources themselves (produce) or exploit the discoveries made by others (scrounge). The extensive literature on producer-scrounger dynamics has mainly focused on scramble competition over readily accessible resources, thereby largely neglecting the variety of scrounging techniques individuals may use as well as the role of investment in food handling. Furthermore, although individual differences in boldness and social factors such as dominance have been described to influence foraging tactics, their potential interplay and effect in foraging contexts beyond the conventional producer-scrounger game remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between social-foraging tactic use and dominance, pair bonds and boldness in a foraging experiment focused on food handling and alternative scrounging tactics. We conducted a producer-scrounger experiment in a captive group of rooks in which individuals could produce by pulling up baited strings, or scrounge by retrieving fallen food items or joining a producer. There were three key findings: (1) dominant rooks adopted the producer tactic more often and more successfully than subordinates; (2) producing and scrounging by tolerance led to mixed benefits to paired birds; (3) bold birds scrounged by retrieving more often than shy birds. Importantly, individuals were highly consistent in their tactic use across conditions differing in food availability. Our study highlights the importance of taking both social factors and boldness (heterogeneity) into account when studying social-foraging dynamics and offers empirical data on food handling and alternative scrounging tactics that can be used to extend current models and experiments on social foraging.

While it is well known that vultures use intraspecific social information as they forage, the possibility of inter-guild social information transfer and the resulting multi-species social dilemmas has not been explored. Here, we use data on arrival times at carcasses to show that such social information transfer occurs, with raptors acting as producers of information and vultures acting as scroungers of information. We develop a game-theoretic model to show that competitive asymmetry, whereby vultures dominate raptors at carcasses, predicts this evolutionary outcome. We support this theoretical prediction using empirical data from competitive interactions at carcasses. Finally, we use an individual-based model to show that these producer-scrounger dynamics lead to vultures being vulnerable to declines in raptor populations. Our results show that social information transfer can lead to important non-trophic interactions among species and highlight important potential links among social evolution, community ecology and conservation biology. With vulture populations suffering global declines, our study underscores the importance of ecosystem-based management for these endangered keystone species.

J	Kameda, T; Nakanishi, D				Kameda, T; Nakanishi, D			Cost-benefit analysis of social/cultural learning in a nonstationary uncertain environment - An evolutionary simulation and an experiment with human subjects	EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						social learning; cultural transmission; conformity; nonstationary environment; producer-scrounger equilibrium	CULTURAL TRANSMISSION; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; BEHAVIOR	Social/cultural learning is an effective way to reduce uncertainty about the environment, helping individuals adopt an adaptive behavior cheaply. Although this is evident for learning about temporally stable targets, such as acquisition of a skill in avoiding toxic foods, the utility of social/cultural learning in a temporally unstable environment is less clear, since knowledge acquired by social learning may be outdated. This paper addresses the adaptive value of social/cultural learning in a nonstationary environment both theoretically and empirically. We first conducted an evolutionary computer simulation that extended Henrich and Boyd's [Evol. Hum. Behav. 19 (1998) 215.] model of cultural transmission, with the following results. When individual learning about the nonstationary environment is costly, a mixed equilibrium emerges in the population, where members who engage in costly individual learning and members who skip the information search and free-ride on other members' search efforts coexist at a stable ratio. Such a "producer-scrounger" structure qualifies effectiveness of social/cultural learning severely, especially "conformity bias" when using social information. We then tested these propositions by an experiment implementing a nonstationary uncertain environment in a laboratory. The results supported our thesis. Implications of these findings and some future directions are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Dubois, F; Richard-Dionne, E				Dubois, Frederique; Richard-Dionne, Etienne			Consequences of multiple simultaneous opportunities to exploit others' efforts on free riding	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						evolutionary stable strategy; game theory; producer-scrounger game; simultaneous scrounging opportunities; stochastic effects	NUTMEG MANNIKINS; SCROUNGER USE; GROUP-SIZE; PRODUCER; INTERFERENCE; PROVISION	Individuals within a group do not all act in the same way: Typically, the investors (or producers) put efforts into producing resources while the free riders (or scroungers) benefit from these resources without contributing. In behavioral ecology, the prevalence of free riders can be predicted by a well-known game-theoretical model-the producer-scrounger (PS) model-where group members have the options to either search for resources (producers) or exploit the efforts of others (scroungers). The PS model has received some empirical support, but its predictions, surprisingly, are based on the strict assumption that only one resource can be exploited at a time. Yet, multiple simultaneous opportunities to exploit others' efforts should frequently occur in nature. Here, we combine analytic and simulation approaches to explore the effect of multiple simultaneous scrounging opportunities on tactic use. Our analyses demonstrate that scrounging rates should increase with the number of simultaneous opportunities. As such, the amount and spatial distribution (i.e., clumped vs. dispersed) of resources as well as the risk of predation are key predictors of scrounging behavior. Because scroungers contribute to reducing the speed of resource exploitation, the model proposed here has direct relevance to the exploitation and sustainability of renewable resources.

Within a given species, individuals might differ in their propensity to use such a tactic, in a similar manner to which they differ in their general level of aggressiveness. Standard metabolic rate is often viewed as a proxy for energy requirements. For this reason, it should directly impact on both kleptoparasitism and aggressiveness when individuals have to share the same food source. In the present study we first assessed the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of 128 juvenile European eels (Anguilla anguilla) by the determination of oxygen consumption. We then tested how the SMR could influence agonistic behavior of individuals competing for food in three distinct trials evenly distributed over three months. We demonstrate that SMR positively correlates with attacks (sum of bite and push events) in all trials. Similarly SMR correlated positively with kleptoparasitism (food theft), but this was significant only for the third trial (month 3). To our knowledge, the present study is the first reporting a link between kleptoparasitism and SMR in a fish species. This has ecological implications owing to the fact that this species is characterized by an environmental sex determination linked to early growth rate. We discuss theses findings in the light of the producer-scrounger foraging game. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Both theoretical and empirical work have shown that group-level use of these alternative tactics is influenced by environmental conditions including group size and food distribution, and individual tactic use can be influenced by several measures of individual state, including body condition. Because body condition has been shown to be heritable for various species, social foraging tactics may also be heritable. We looked for evidence of heritability in social foraging tactic use in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) by testing whether: (1) natural variation in body condition correlates with tactic use, (2) there are family-related differences in body condition, and (3) there are family-related differences in observed tactic use. Tactic use in the zebra finch was significantly related to body condition; individuals with lower body condition scores had a significantly higher use of the scrounger tactic as predicted from variance-sensitive producer-scrounger models. Body-condition scores differed significantly between families, suggesting that this aspect of individual state may have a heritable component. Finally, we recorded significant family-related differences in the use of producer and scrounger alternatives. These results are consistent with heritability in observed tactic use resulting from an inheritance of individual state, in this case body condition, which itself influences tactic use. Understanding how and why individuals differ in their use of alternative tactics is fundamental as it may provide important insights into inter-individual variation in fitness.

J	Afshar, M; Hall, CL; Giraldeau, LA				Afshar, Mohammad; Hall, Carolyn L.; Giraldeau, Luc-Alain			Zebra finches scrounge more when patches vary in quality: experimental support of the linear operator learning rule	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						decision making; evolutionary game theory; frequency-dependent selection; learning rule; linear operator; producer-scrounger; risk sensitivity; social foraging; Taeniopygia guttata; zebra finch	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; TACTIC USE; PRACTICAL GUIDE; PRODUCER; EVOLUTION; FLOCKS; GAMES; RISK; EFFICIENCY; BEHAVIOR	The use of evolutionary game theory and the concept of the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) have come under criticism lately because game-theoretic models are often constrained to overly simplistic situations. Furthermore, game-theoretic models commit the behavioural gambit, that is, they assume that individuals have some unspecified decision mechanism that duplicates the outcomes that would be expected from natural selection acting on genetic alternatives. The producer-scrounger game is an ideal illustration of the criticisms aimed at the game-theoretic approach; it has generated a number of game-theoretic models that make specific predictions for highly simplified foraging conditions. Simulation models of the producer-scrounger game that incorporate the linear operator learning rule, however, have been more successful in replicating the empirical results. In these models, groups of animals forage for patches of food using a linear operator learning rule. The linear operator model furthermore provides a new prediction about the effect of variation in patch quality within a producer-scrounger game. Current models based on evolutionarily stable strategies and empirical investigations have always assumed or used patches of uniform quality. Yet patches vary in quality and some environments are potentially more variable than others. The linear operator model predicts an increase in scrounging behaviour when patch quality varies. We tested this prediction using captive foraging flocks of male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in two treatments with variable and nonvariable patch quality. The results show that as individuals have more experience in the variable environment, they increase their scrounging behaviour.

This might impair the results and lead to misinterpretation about the learning abilities of the targeted species. In order to provide an alternative to the individual-based tests, we investigated for the first time the operant conditioning of four similar groups (50 individuals per tank) of sea bass. We used two computerized self-feeder devices per tank, each coupled with individual electronic identification and that were alternately activated during varying positive appetitive reinforcement period of time (7 to 1 day). Learning abilities were examined at both group and individual levels. At the group level, the operant conditioning was demonstrated as the triggering activity significantly decreased when the device was turned off and increased when it was turned on, whatever the reinforcement period duration. The individual level analysis revealed a more complex situation with fish showing different learning performances that can be best explained through the producer-scrounger game theory.

G., Firth, J. A., Davidson, G. L., Crofts, S. J., & Quinn, J. L. (2021) Cognition and covariance in the producer-scrounger game. Journal of Animal Ecology, . When foraging in groups, individuals can either acquire their own resources, as producers, or profit from the work of other individuals, as scroungers. Individuals vary in how much they rely on one foraging tactic over the other. Yet, each of these foraging tactics presents unique cognitive challenges. Using a field experiment with a mixed-species flock of birds, Reichert et al. (2021) investigated how production learning (i.e. successfully feeding from their assigned rewarded feeder) and scrounging propensity (i.e. collecting food from a non-assigned feeders by following another individual) are related at an individual level, as well as the repeatability of both production learning and scrounging propensity. The authors show that overall, (a) individuals learned to scrounge, (b) individuals who rely more on scrounging took longer to learn their assigned feeder and (c) variation in each cognitive trait was mostly explained by individual behavioural flexibility rather than by consistent differences between individuals. Since learning was negatively correlated with the use of an alternative foraging tactic (i.e. scrounging), results of this study also suggest that individual choice of foraging tactics should be considered when evaluating cognitive abilities in wild animals.

The local enhancement conundrum: In search of the adaptive value of a social learning mechanism	THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						Stimulus enhancement; Local enhancement; Social foraging; Producer-scrounger game; Game theory	EVOLUTION; INSIGHTS; ANIMALS; FLOCKS; RISK	Social learning mechanisms are widely thought to vary in their degree of complexity as well as in their prevalence in the natural world. While learning the properties of a stimulus that generalize to similar stimuli at other locations (stimulus enhancement) prima fade appears more useful to an animal than learning about a specific stimulus at a specific location (local enhancement), empirical evidence suggests that the latter is much more widespread in nature. Simulating populations engaged in a producer scrounger game, we sought to deploy mathematical models to identify the adaptive benefits of reliance on local enhancement and/or stimulus enhancement, and the alternative conditions favoring their evolution. Surprisingly, we found that while stimulus enhancement readily evolves, local enhancement is advantageous only under highly restricted conditions: when generalization of information was made unreliable or when error in social learning was high. Our results generate a conundrum over how seemingly conflicting empirical and theoretical findings can be reconciled. Perhaps the prevalence of local enhancement in nature is due to stimulus enhancement costs independent of the learning task itself (e.g. predation risk), perhaps natural habitats are often characterized by unreliable yet highly rewarding payoffs, or perhaps local enhancement occurs less frequently, and stimulus enhancement more frequently, than widely believed.

We develop a model to demonstrate how competition can facilitate or constrain an individual's ability to use information when acquiring resources. As resource distribution underpins both selection on information use and the strength and nature of competition between individuals, we demonstrate interdependencies between the two that should be common in nature. Individuals in our model can search for resources either personally or by using social information. We explore selection on social information use across a comprehensive range of ecological conditions, generalizing the producer scrounger framework to a wide diversity of taxa and resources. We show that resource ecology defined by scarcity, depletion rate and monopolizability determines patterns of individual differences in social information use. These differences suggest coevolutionary processes linking dominance systems and social information use, with implications for the evolutionary demography of populations.	[Lee, Alexander E.

Although real ecological communities contain many gregarious species, whose foraging behaviour should be influenced by socially transmitted information, few theoretical studies have examined the possibility that social foraging might resolve this paradox. I considered a predator population in which individuals play the producer-scrounger foraging game in one-prey-one-predator and two-prey-onepredator systems. I analysed the stability of a coexisting equilibrium point in the one-prey system and that of nonequilibrium dynamics in the two-prey system. The results revealed that social foraging could stabilize both systems, and thereby resolve the paradox of enrichment when scrounging behaviour (i.e. kleptoparasitism) is prevalent in predators. This suggests a previously neglected mechanism underlying a powerful effect of group-living animals on the sustainability of ecological communities.

Our model includes producers, scroungers, and an opportunistic forager that can both produce and scrounge but with reduced efficiency. We show that these three strategies can coexist only in the unlikely case that the opportunist's loss in searching ability is exactly equal to its gain in scrounging ability. However, all pairs of strategies can coexist. Three parameters control the proportions of coexisting strategists: the degree of compatibility between the opportunist's producing and scrounging activities; the proportion of food patches that are shared with scrounging individuals; and the effective group size. When there is little incompatibility between producing and scrounging, opportunists will always be present, unless the producer is able to consume most of the patch without sharing. The opportunist strategy is always excluded when there is a high degree of incompatibility between producing and scrounging. We consider the organismal and ecological factors that are likely to affect all three parameters. Our model predicts that scrounging behavior is likely to be selected in a wide range of foraging groups and that it may impose a considerable cost on sociality.

Recent theory on behavioural plasticity in games predicts that individuals should differ in their plasticity or responsiveness and hence in their degree of behavioural adjustment. Moreover, individuals are predicted to be consistent in their plasticity within and across biological contexts. These predictions have yet to be tested empirically and so we examine the behavioural adjustment of individual nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura punctulata), gregarious ground-feeding passerines, when playing two different social foraging games: producer-scrounger (PS) and patch-choice (PC) games. We found: (i) significant individual differences in plasticity and sampling behaviour in each of the two games, (ii) individual differences in sampling behaviour were consistent over different test conditions within a game (PC) and over a six month period (PS), (iii) but neither individual plasticity nor sampling behaviour was correlated from one social foraging game to another. The rate at which birds sampled alternative tactics was positively associated with seed intake in PS trials but negatively associated in PC trials. These results suggest that games with frequency dependence of pay-offs can maintain differences in behavioural plasticity but that an important component of this plasticity is group-and/or context-specific.

The scrounger tactic may provide greater antipredator benefits than the producer tactic because "scroungers" hop with their heads up and tend to occupy central positions in a group, whereas "producers" hop with their heads down and tend to occupy edge positions. We tested whether increasing an individual's vulnerability to predation (using wing-loading manipulations) causes an increased preference for the scrounger tactic in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Wing-loading manipulations were effective at increasing focal individuals' perception of vulnerability to predation; treatment individuals increased their total time allocated to vigilance, whereas control individuals did not. Treatment individuals also increased their use of the scrounger tactic (proportion of hops with head up) and scrounged a greater proportion of patches, whereas control individuals exhibited no changes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the scrounger tactic confers greater antipredator benefits than the producer tactic, although whether antipredator benefits are achieved through differences in head orientation, spatial position, or both, remains unclear. Our finding that individuals adjust their use of the scrounger tactic according to changes in their phenotype provides evidence for phenotype-limited allocation strategies in producer-scrounger games.

Such individual differences are correlated with personality traits, suggesting that personality could directly affect individuals' ability to collect personal or social information. Alternatively, the link between personality and information use could simply emerge as a by-product of the sequential decision-making process in a frequency-dependent context. Indeed, when the gains associated with behavioural options depend on the choices of others, an individual's sequence of arrival could constrain its choice of options leading to the emergence of correlated behaviours. Any factor such as personality that affects decision order could thus be correlated with information use. To test this new explanation, we developed an individual-based model that simulates a group of animals engaged in a game of sequential frequency-dependent decision: a producer-scrounger game. Our results confirm that the sequence of decision, in this case enforced by the order in which animals enter a foraging area, consistently influences their mean tactic use and their individual plasticity, an outcome reminiscent of the correlation reported between personality and social information use.

Man-made ecosystems exhibit similar dynamics and, in the case of mobile app stores, can be said to perform optimization as developers seek to maximize app downloads. This work aims to understand stability and instability within app store dynamics and how it affects fitness. The investigation is carried out with AppEco, a model of the iOS App Store, which was extended for this paper and updated to model the store from 2008 to 2014. AppEco models apps containing features, developers who build the apps, users who download apps according to their preferences, and an app store that presents apps to the users. It also models developers who use commonly observed strategies to build their apps: innovator, milker, optimizer, copycat, and flexible (the ability to choose any strategy). Results show that despite the success of the copycat strategy, there is a clear stable state for low proportion of copycats in developer populations, mirroring results in theoretical biology for producer-scrounger systems. The results also show that the best fitness is achieved when the evolutionary optimizer (as producer) and copycat (as scrounger) strategies coexist together in stable proportions.

No evidence for negative frequency-dependent feeding performance in relation to personality	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						barnacle goose; boldness; foraging strategy; negative frequency-dependent selection; personality; producer-scrounger game	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ANIMAL PERSONALITIES; FITNESS CONSEQUENCES; AVIAN PERSONALITIES; BARNACLE GEESE; CAPTIVE FLOCKS; SOCIAL-CONTEXT; SPICE FINCHES; BEHAVIOR; PRODUCER	An increasing number of studies report the presence of consistent individual differences in behavior and/or physiology over time and context, known as animal personality. A pivotal question in animal personality research concerns the mechanism(s) responsible for its evolution and maintenance. Negative frequency-dependent selection is considered to be one of these important mechanisms, although evidence for this is largely absent. Here, we studied whether the feeding performance of barnacle geese was negative frequency-dependent in a producer-scrounger game. We studied the feeding time of one bold or one shy individual in groups consisting of only bold or shy companions to study if the rare type in the group performs best. A previous study with this species showed that scrounging increased with shyness. Hence, we expected shy individuals to do better in the presence of bold companions due to the increased scrounging opportunity and bold individuals to do better in the presence of shy companions as there were ample opportunities to produce food. We found no evidence for negative frequency-dependent feeding success; rather, we found that, independent of their boldness score, all individuals enjoyed higher feeding success when foraging with bold than with shy companions. The higher foraging success of individuals foraging with bold companions is explained by a higher joining proportion in the presence of bold companions. Our results provide no evidence for negative frequency-dependent feeding success in barnacle geese but indicate that both bold and shy individuals can increase their foraging returns by associating with bold individuals.

J	Ranta, E; Peuhkuri, N; Laurila, A; Rita, H; Metcalfe, NB				Ranta, E; Peuhkuri, N; Laurila, A; Rita, H; Metcalfe, NB			Producers, scroungers and foraging group structure	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							COOPERATION; INFORMATION; MODEL; BIRDS	The producer-scrounger model of Barnard gr Sibly (1981, Anim. Behav., 29, 543-550) predicts that at a certain ratio of producers and scroungers in a foraging group the payoff curves for individuals of the two phenotypes intercept. At this point all the group members obtain equal payoffs. In this paper, the original model is elaborated further by allowing individuals to differ not only in their food-finding abilities but also in their abilities to compete for the food once it is found. As in Barnard & Sibly's original model foraging individuals are assumed to share information about the whereabouts of food patches and to benefit from patches found by others. Here it is determined under which combinations of searching and sharing characters food intake rate in mixed-phenotype groups would be equal for producing and scrounging individuals. In the present model the payoffs are much affected by both the finder's advantage (the fraction of prey available only to the finder of the food-patch) and the combination of the foraging characters of the two phenotypes. Generally the intake rate of producers increases with their presence in the group and with increases in the finder's advantage. Our model suggests that the equal payoffs arise only when the relative food-searching and competitive abilities of producers and scroungers fall within a narrow range of options acknowledging also the finder's advantage. Moreover, such combinations are predicted to be unstable if only foraging benefits are called for in group formation, this being a common feature of social foraging models incorporating foraging role asymmetries.

J	Kuroda, K; Kameda, T				Kuroda, Kiri; Kameda, Tatsuya			You watch my back, I'll watch yours: Emergence of collective risk monitoring through tacit coordination in human social foraging	EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Coordination; Producer-scrounger game; Social foraging; Risk; Emotional arousal; Cognitive control	COGNITIVE LOAD; TRADE-OFF; TRUST; GAME; EXPECTATIONS; COOPERATION; EVOLUTION	Predation risk is a significant concern when social animals including humans engage in foraging. When people search for resources together, individuals often find themselves in a producer-scrounger game, in which some individuals bear the cost of risk monitoring while others can free ride on those efforts. A theoretically rational strategy is to mix foraging and risk monitoring randomly with the same probability across all members, but such uncoordinated action often yields inefficiencies of under- or over-supply of risk monitoring in a group. Here, we examined whether people could spontaneously develop a coordinated risk-monitoring system, alternating vigilance and foraging in a pair. Given that human cooperation is vulnerable to fear of exploitation and emotional arousal under risk, we hypothesized that such sources of anxiety would be potential disruptors to coordination. In a laboratory experiment, two participants worked on a "treasure hunt" task simultaneously, in which they chose between low or high vigilance against predators during foraging without verbal communication. If one chose high vigilance with personal cost, it yielded a spillover benefit to the other. Besides behavioral choices, each participant's physiological arousal (skin conductance response) and cognitive effort (tonic pupil dilation) were measured during the task. Results showed that some pairs were actually able to develop a role-alternating system over time through tacit coordination, but coordinated action was also vulnerable to anxiety and mistrust among participants. Overall, these results imply that, besides the mutual behavioral control that often characterizes repeated interaction, cognitive control of emotional arousal may be a critical psychological factor for the emergence of coordinated cooperation.

It is usually invoked in the context of challenges arising from complex intragroup structures, hierarchies, and alliances. However, a fundamental aspect of group living remains largely unexplored as a driving force in cognitive evolution: the competition between individuals searching for resources (producers) and conspecifics that parasitize their findings (scroungers). In populations of social foragers, abilities that enable scroungers to steal by outsmarting producers, and those allowing producers to prevent theft by outsmarting scroungers, are likely to be beneficial and may fuel a cognitive arms race. Using analytical theory and agent-based simulations, we present a general model for such a race that is driven by the producer-scrounger game and show that the race's plausibility is dramatically affected by the nature of the evolving abilities. If scrounging and scrounging avoidance rely on separate, strategy-specific cognitive abilities, arms races are short-lived and have a limited effect on cognition. However, general cognitive abilities that facilitate both scrounging and scrounging avoidance undergo stable, long-lasting arms races. Thus, ubiquitous foraging interactions may lead to the evolution of general cognitive abilities in social animals, without the requirement of complex intragroup structures.

The evolutionary dynamics of this trade-off have been explored mathematically through the producer-scrounger game, which has highlighted socially exploitative behaviours as a major potential cost of group living. However, our understanding of the tight interplay that can exist between social dominance and scrounging behaviour is limited. To date, only two theoretical studies have explored this relationship systematically, demonstrating that because scrounging requires joining a competitor at a resource, it should become exclusive to high-ranking individuals when resources are monopolisable. In this study, we explore the predictions of this model through observations of the natural social foraging behaviour of a wild population of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). We collected data through over 800 h of focal follows of 101 adults and juveniles across two troops over two 3-month periods. By recording over 7,900 social foraging decisions at two spatial scales we show that, when resources are large and economically indefensible, the joining behaviour required for scrounging can occur across all social ranks. When, in contrast, dominant individuals can aggressively appropriate a resource, such joining behaviour becomes increasingly difficult to employ with decreasing social rank because adult individuals can only join others lower ranking than themselves. Our study supports theoretical predictions and highlights potentially important individual constraints on the ability of individuals of low social rank to use social information, driven by competition with dominant conspecifics over monopolisable resources.

Owing to the intrinsic stochastic and frequency-dependent nature of learning dynamics, these rules are often studied in evolutionary biology via agent-based computer simulations. In this paper, we show that stochastic approximation theory can help to qualitatively understand learning dynamics and formulate analytical models for the evolution of learning rules. We consider a population of individuals repeatedly interacting during their lifespan, and where the stage game faced by the individuals fluctuates according to an environmental stochastic process. Individuals adjust their behavioral actions according to learning rules belonging to the class of experience-weighted attraction learning mechanisms, which includes standard reinforcement and Bayesian learning as special cases. We use stochastic approximation theory in order to derive differential equations governing action play probabilities, which turn out to have qualitative features of mutator-selection equations. We then perform agent-based simulations to find the conditions where the deterministic approximation is closest to the original stochastic learning process for standard 2-action 2-player fluctuating games, where interaction between learning rules and preference reversal may occur. Finally, we analyze a simplified model for the evolution of learning in a producer-scrounger game, which shows that the exploration rate can interact in a non-intuitive way with other features of co-evolving learning rules. Overall, our analyses illustrate the usefulness of applying stochastic approximation theory in the study of animal learning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous research has found evidence that feeding rates art? higher (it the group edge in many species, but these studies have not represented the entire breadth of dietary diversity and ecological situations faced by many animals. In parlicularly, the presence of concentrated, defendable food patches can lead to increased feeding rates by dominants in the center of the group that are able to monopolize or defend these areas. To fully understand the tradeoffs of within-group spatial position in relation to a variety of factors, it is important to be able to predict where individuals should preferable, position themselves in relation to feeding rates and food competition. A qualitative model is presented here to Predict how food depletion time, abundance of food patches within a group, and the presence of prior knowledge of feeding sites affect the payoffs of different within group spatial positions for dominant and subordinate animals. In general, when feeding on small abundant food items, individuals (it the front edge of the group should have higher foraging success. When feeding oil slowly depleted, rare food items, dominants will often have the highest feeding rates in the center of the group). Between these two extreme points of a continuum, (in individuals optimal spatial position is predicted to be influenced hi, an additional combination of factors, such as group size, group spread, satiation rates, and the presence of producer-scrounger tactics.

Information-sharing (IS) and; producer-scrounger (PS) games predict different joining frequencies because they make distinct assumptions about food searching. IS games assume individuals can search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while PS games assume incompatible search modes; individuals search either as a producer, detecting only finding opportunities, or as a scrounger, detecting only joining opportunities; To determine the search assumption for flocks of ground-feeding granivores we studied the behaviour of spice finches, Lonchura punctulata, foraging in indoor aviaries for clumps of hidden millet seed. We looked for behaviour patterns preceding finding and joining events. An analysis of covariance showed that the frequencies of hopping with the head pointing up and down were statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the seed distribution, the birds' relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly When the seed distribution made any use of the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the head up declined to zero. Consequently, in ground-feeding birds such as spice finches, finding and joining behaviour conform more closely to the assumptions of a PS rather than an IS game.

Various methods are investigated to solve CVRP in last few decades, the most popular way of solving CVRP is splitting the task into two different phases: firstly, assigning customers under different vehicles and secondly, finding optimal route of each vehicle. Sweep clustering algorithm is well studied for clustering nodes. On the other hand, route optimization is simply a traveling salesman problem (TSP) and a number of TSP optimization methods are investigated for this purpose. This study investigates a variant of Sweep algorithm for clustering nodes and different SI based methods for route generation to get optimal CVRP solution. In conventional Sweep algorithm, cluster formation starts from 00 and consequently advance toward 3600 to consider all the nodes. In this study, Sweep cluster are considered from different starting angle. On the other hand, two well-known Swarm Intelligence (SI) methods (i.e., Ant Colony Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)) and two recent SI based algorithms (i.e., Producer-Scrounger Method and Velocity Tentative PSO) are considered for route optimization. We have compared the performance of these methods to solve CVRP. The experimental results on a large number of benchmark CVRP reveal that different starting angle has positive effect on Sweep clustering and finally, VTPSO is able to produce better solution than other methods.

Grouping with kin may reduce the frequency of exploitation because kin selection should favor individuals that imposed fewer costs on their kin. However, taking into account the gains of the exploited individual, allowing kin to exploit one's efforts may be less costly than allowing exploitation from nonkin. In this case, there may be higher frequencies of exploitative behaviors among related than unrelated individuals. In order to understand the net effect of genetic relatedness on intragroup exploitation, we developed a model that considers the inclusive fitness consequences of "producing" (searching for food) and "scrounging" (exploiting the food discoveries of others) when foraging with relatives, while simultaneously allowing individuals to show differential tolerance toward scrounging by kin versus nonkin. The model predicts that increased relatedness can lead to higher levels of exploitation when producers are kin-selected to be more tolerant of scrounging from relatives compared with unrelated scroungers, for example, by being more aggressive toward nonkin. We tested this prediction empirically in captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) foraging either in flocks with full siblings or in flocks of unrelated individuals. Flocks of related zebra finches had higher frequencies of scrounging and lower levels of aggressive interactions compared with flocks of unrelated zebra finches. The results suggest that producers may be kin-selected to allow relatives to scrounge.

These foraging advantages rely on the occurrence of 'joining': feeding from food discovered or captured by others. Joining occurs in most social species but the assumptions underlying: its analysis have been clarified only recently, giving rise to two classes of model: information-sharing and producer-scrounger models. Recent experimental evidence suggests that Joining in ground-feeding birds might be best analysed as a producer-scrounger game, with some intriguing consequences for the spatial distribution of foragers and patch exploitation.

ETHOLOGY			English	Article						foraging; producer-scrounger; social information	ROACH RUTILUS-RUTILUS; NUTRITIONAL STATE; NETWORKS PREDICT; ENERGY RESERVES; SHOALS; POSITION; BEHAVIOR; FISH; INFORMATION; CHOICE	Internal state, in this case hunger, is known to influence both the organisation of animal groups and the social foraging interactions that occur within them. In this study, we investigated the effects of hunger upon the time taken to locate and converge upon hidden simulated prey patches in a socially foraging fish, the threespine stickle-back (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We predicted that groups of food--deprived fish would find and recruit to prey patches faster than recently fed groups, reasoning that they might search more rapidly and be more attentive to inadvertent social information produced by other foragers. Instead we saw no difference between the two groups in the time taken to find the patches and found that in fact, once prey patches had been discovered, it was the recently fed fish that converged on them most rapidly. This finding is likely due to the fact that recently fed fish tend to organise themselves into fewer but larger subgroups, which arrived at the food patch together. Hunger has a significant impact upon the social organisation of the fish shoals, and it appears that this has a stronger effect upon the rate at which they converged upon the food patches than does internal state itself.

Interspecific social information transfer can play a key role in many aspects of animal ecology from foraging to habitat selection to predator avoidance. 2. Within scavenging communities, avian scavengers often act as producers and mammalian scavengers act as scroungers, but we predict that species-specific cueing will allow for mammalian scavengers to utilize particular avian scavenger species using preferred food sources similar to their own preferences. 3. We use empirical and theoretic approaches to assess interactions between mammalian and avian scavengers in one of the most diverse scavenging guilds in Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. 4. Using a spatially explicit model and data from experimental carcasses, we found evidence that mammals benefit from local enhancement provided by vultures and that mammalian-avian following patterns are consistent with the idea that species-specific cueing is occurring. 5. Results suggest that ongoing population declines in avian scavengers may have significant impacts on mammalian scavengers and potentially create trophic cascades.

J	Coolen, I; Giraldeau, LA				Coolen, I; Giraldeau, LA			Incompatibility between antipredatory vigilance and scrounger tactic in nutmeg mannikins, Lonchura punctulata	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							GROUP-SIZE; PREDATION RISK; HOUSE SPARROWS; STURNUS-VULGARIS; FLOCK SIZE; BEHAVIOR; PRODUCERS; COMPETITION; STRATEGIES; MAMMALS	Most social foragers must search for food while avoiding predators. Group-foraging nutmeg mannikins engaged in a producer-scrounger game search for their own food (play producer) by hopping with the head down and search for others' food discoveries (play scrounger) by hopping with the head up. If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence to more joining by foragers. We tested this prediction as well as the extent to which stationary birds use head up exclusively for antipredatory purposes and hopping birds use head up for foraging purposes only. We observed three flocks of nutmeg mannikins searching for hidden clumps of food in an indoor aviary. We used a 2 x 2 factorial design in which both the distance to a safe refuge and the food distribution were manipulated. The use of head up by stationary and eating birds increased significantly with increased distance to cover. Distance to cover, however, had no effect on the use of the scrounger tactic or on the level of joining. We found no evidence of compatibility between the scrounger tactic and antipredatory vigilance. Our results provide the first unambiguous evidence for the existence of two distinct and incompatible patterns of vigilance for predators and for conspecifics.

Foraging groups may form via different mechanisms depending on the absolute levels of at least two relative spatial scales. I present four group size models for environments composed of two nested patch scales. Second-order patches contain first-order patches that correspond to food patches. Individuals within a given second-order patch are able to monitor their conspecifics' behavior, and the number of individuals attending a first-order patch defines group size. I then test the models' predictions with Parasitic Jaegers (Stercorarius parasiticus) kleptoparasitizing fish from Common Terns (Sterna hirundo). In this context, tern fishing grounds and flying terns that carried fish correspond to the jaegers' second and first-order patches, respectively. The Dispersion and Aggregation models assume that foragers have perfect knowledge of the spatial distribution of food and form groups in conformity to an ideal free distribution. The Producer-Scrounger (PS) and Information-Sharing (IS) models, however, assume that foragers are unaware of the food patches' location and form groups as some foragers join and exploit the food discoveries of others. I used four fitness currencies: probability of obtaining a fish, PF; gross and net rates of energy intake; and energy efficiency. All currencies decreased with group size except the PF currency, which did not vary for group sizes of one and two. Because fitness never increased with group size, the Aggregation model was ruled out. Fish-securing rates of jaegers that initiated and joined chases did not differ. Assuming that initiating and joining a chase correspond to a producing and a scrounging event, respectively, both the PS and IS model then predict that group size should match jaeger abundance. Because group size leveled rapidly with jaeger abundance, both models were discarded. The Dispersion model predicts that group size should decrease with an increase in tern availability when the latter is limiting. Otherwise, jaegers should not form groups unless there is no cost to do so, such as with the PF currency in which solitary jaegers and pairs experience equal fitness. The facts that group size did not reach 1.0 at high tern availability and that it averaged 1.5 when it did not decrease further with tern availability suggest that jaegers may form groups according to the Dispersion model with the PF currency. This conclusion is discussed in relation to the other assumptions underlying the Dispersion model.

J	Hamblin, S; Giraldeau, LA				Hamblin, Steven; Giraldeau, Luc-Alain			Finding the evolutionarily stable learning rule for frequency-dependent foraging	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						foraging; learning rules; producer-scrounger game	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; SOCIAL FORAGERS; STRATEGIES; BEHAVIOR; PRODUCER; MODEL; INFORMATION; DECISIONS; PREDATORS; ECOLOGY	The cognitive mechanisms by which an organism comes to employ an optimal response to a situation are of great interest in behavioural ecology, but the basis and form of these mechanisms have been little studied. One approach employs learning rules, which are mathematical expressions that calculate the value of the behavioural alternatives in an organism's repertoire based on past and present rewards to those alternatives. Previous work on these learning rules has examined the performance of rules to determine whether they can achieve evolutionarily stable optimums. However, not only has this work tested rules in isolation, but the parameter values chosen to test them have been few and chosen arbitrarily. Moreover, the environments in which the rules have been evaluated are unchanging, a condition that does not favour learning. In this study we extend simulation work on three learning rules (relative payoff sum, linear operator and perfect memory). We use a genetic algorithm to both estimate the optimal parameter values for each rule and place the rules in competition with each other in a foraging game with a changing environment. Our results confirm earlier findings that the relative payoff sum is an ES learning rule. However, the results go much further because they show that the form of the learning rule that qualifies as evolutionarily stable combines near inextinguishable producing with highly responsive scrounging. The relative payoff sum may provide a single rule that can account for the way an animal's ecology can come to affect its specific set of learning sensitivities.

Be early or be tolerated: vervet monkey, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, foraging strategies in a dispersed resource	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						Chlorocebus pygerythrus; early arrival; feeding competition; intragroup spatial position; predation risk; producer-scrounger strategy; social foraging; tolerated scrounging	INDIVIDUAL SPATIAL CHOICE; BROWN CAPUCHIN MONKEYS; FEEDING COMPETITION; PREDATION RISK; TACTIC USE; DOMINANCE; BEHAVIOR; GEOMETRY; PERSONALITY; SCROUNGERS	Among social foragers, individuals can actively search for and find food (the producers) or join already discovered food patches (the scroungers). Compared to scroungers, producers often occupy more dangerous outer spatial positions in the group, but they benefit from the finder's advantage, which is the amount of food eaten before the arrival of others. Scroungers may occupy safer positions but they face feeding competition when joining a patch already occupied by others. Here, we report factors influencing intragroup spatial position, feeding strategies and feeding success for a group of wild vervet monkeys, C. pygerythrus, at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda. We collected data using behavioural observations and field experimentation (N 1/4 132 trials) where we set up an artificial food patch with dispersed food rewards. We found that individuals who spent more time in the front-outer position of a moving group produced more. Producers that had a greater finder's time advantage (fed undetected by group members for longer periods) had a greater finder's advantage (consumed more food items before the arrival of other group members), and scroungers that arrived earlier had greater overall feeding success. We found that when the scrounger was higher ranking than other individuals at the patch, they used displacement scrounging (supplanted at least one individual from the patch to gain access to the food resource). However, feeding success did not differ between displacement scrounging and tolerated scrounging (when the scrounger fed at the patch with at least one other individual). Interestingly, we did not find higher-ranking individuals to have greater feeding success than lower-ranking individuals. Our findings corroborate previous studies showing that even among species with a linear dominance hierarchy and high occurrences of within-group contest competition, dominant individuals do not benefit from feeding advantages at large, dispersed food patches since they cannot monopolize the resource. Furthermore, our results emphasize the need to understand factors influencing feeding tolerance, particularly for subordinate individuals, who need to process ecological and social elements to maximize their food acquisition.

Most producer-scrounger models assume that birds are flexible in using tactics in response to changing conditions and that foragers are phenotypically identical. Individual differences and flexibility in tactic use were investigated in zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata) foraging in two flocks of different composition. Birds varied widely in their use of tactics, and individual differences proved consistent both within and between flocks. Significant adjustments in tactic use occurred from one flock to the other. Results suggest that tactic use in zebra finches foraging in small flocks is characterized by consistency and flexibility. Individual differences in tactic use demonstrate the need to examine further the consequences of phenotypic variation in producer-scrounger models.

Vervet (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) Intragroup Spatial Positioning: Dominants Trade-Off Predation Risk for Increased Food Acquisition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Chlorocebus pygerythrus; Finder's share; Group living; Producer-scrounger strategies; Spatial position	BROWN CAPUCHIN MONKEYS; BABOONS PAPIO-CYNOCEPHALUS; COATIS NASUA-NASUA; FEEDING COMPETITION; FORAGING GROUPS; GROUP-SIZE; SCROUNGING BEHAVIOR; VIGILANCE BEHAVIOR; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; CAPTIVE FLOCKS	The costs and benefits of group-living are not distributed evenly among group members. Individuals that maintain positions on the front, outside edge of the group encounter most predators first, but are more likely to access food patches before others. Therefore a trade-off exists in which a strategy maximizing safety, by staying in the group's center, may lower foraging success, whereas a strategy maximizing food acquisition may increase predation risk. We examined intragroup spatial positions for vervets (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda relative to sex, age, dominance rank, and activity when the group was moving and when it was stationary. We used artificial food patches of varied richness to examine which individuals found new food sources and what share they obtained. When the group was stationary, high-ranking females tended to be at the group's center, while males and subordinates were at the group's edge. Moving and feeding occurred more than expected at the edge, while social behavior took place in the center. When the group was moving, most females stayed in the center of the group, but dominant males and the alpha female foraged at the front, outside edge of the group. These dominants also found more artificial food patches and foraged at greater interindividual distances than those in the center. Whether they found patches or scrounged at the patches found by others, high-ranking individuals obtained more food than subordinates, but their overall share was greatest when they acted as producers rather than scroungers. This likely explains why dominant individuals traded off predation risk for food acquisition by consistently foraging on the front, outside edge of the group farther from conspecifics.

Alternatively they may reduce environmental uncertainty by exploration, while risking no energy rewards and exposure to hazards, and use the information retrieved for subsequent decision making. When exploring, however, animals may adopt different tactics according to individual states. Results: We tested that energy states will affect exploratory behavior by experimenting with wild-caught untrained Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) in fasted or fed states exploring in a novel space with hidden food supply in different patch distribution patterns. Our data revealed that fasted sparrows risked being earlier explorers more often, initiated more exploratory bouts before patches were found, and stayed longer on the ground under both patch patterns. Fasted sparrows discovered more patches and consumed more food than fed sparrows in dispersed, but not necessary so in clumped, patch patterns; whereas fed birds also increased patch finding to a certain level in dispersed patterns. Sparrows of both energy states, however, did not differ in feeding rates in either patch pattern. Conclusions: Exploratory behavior of tree sparrows is state-dependent, which supports our prediction that birds with an energy shortage will be risk-prone and explore more readily. Our study also indicates a game nature of tree sparrow exploratory behavior in a group context when explorers are in different energy states and are exposed to different patch distributions. Birds of lower energy state adopting an active exploring tactic may be favored by obtaining higher energy gains in dispersed patch patterns with lower patch richness. More satiated birds, however, achieved a similar feeding rate by lowered exposure time.

We present a model of social foraging acknowledging the finder's advantage and foraging role asymmetries among individuals but incorporating the possibility that producers and scroungers differ in vigilance level and in vulnerability to predators. This allows simultaneous examination of both foraging benefits and anti-predatory aspects of grouping behaviour. Instead of seeking for equal payoff conditions, we first look for groups in which foraging character combinations and anti-predatory properties of producers and scroungers minimize the phenotype-specific predation hazard over food-intake rate, R-i/I-i, that is, fixed phenotype R-i/I-i minima. In the second approach, we allow individuals to change their foraging status to achieve lower R-i/I-i and look for combinations where it no longer pays for either producers or scroungers to change their roles, that is, evolutionarily stable group compositions, ESS. Various character combinations allow the phenotype-specific minima. In most cases, however, producers' and scroungers' minima are achievable only in different group compositions. The ESS combinations of producers and scroungers deviate widely from those combinations yielding phenotype-specific minima of R-i/I-i. If individuals are allowed to be flexible in adopting either a producer or a scrounger role, ESS group compositions will emerge, even though they are more expensive for both producers and scroungers in terms of R-i/I-i than group compositions yielding the phenotype-specific R-i/I-i minima.

J	Sacramento, TS; Bicca-Marques, JC				Sacramento, Thalita Siqueira; Bicca-Marques, Julio Cesar			Scrounging marmosets eat more when the finder's share is low without changing their searching effort	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						black-tufted marmoset; Callithrix penicillata; Callitrichinae; cooperative breeder; foraging strategy; linear operator learning rule; multimale-multifemale group; producer-scrounger; within-group tolerance	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; STRATEGY CHOICE; TACTIC USE; DOMINANCE; GAME; PRODUCERS	Animals that forage in groups may either search actively for food sources (producers, P) or monitor other members of the group in an attempt to consume resources that producers have encountered (scroungers, S). One factor that may influence the choice of foraging strategy is the finder's share, defined as the proportion of the resource consumed by the producer before the arrival of scroungers. Several models predict that when the finder's share is relatively small, the frequency of scrounging will be high because producing gives only a small benefit compared to playing scrounger. A model based on a linear operator learning rule confirmed this prediction and further predicted that individuals would change their foraging strategy gradually in response to environmental changes. We tested these predictions in an experiment involving three groups (N 1/4 18 individuals) of free-ranging black-tufted marmosets, Callithrix penicillata. We manipulated the finder's share at artificial feeding stations by controlling the distribution of food rewards (slices of banana) among baited platforms. We divided our field experiments into two conditions low finder's share (few food-rich patches) and high finder's share (many food-poor patches). Most (15/18) marmosets consumed more banana slices as scroungers in the low finder's share condition than in the high finder's share condition, as expected by the theory. However, individuals did not modify their frequency of use of the strategies in both conditions and did not show gradual learning as expected by the linear operator learning rule. We suggest that in social groups with high levels of tolerance and cooperation, such as those of marmosets, scrounging individuals can have higher foraging success without increasing their searching effort by sharing productive food patches with producers and other scroungers.

Alternative strategies in avian scavengers: how subordinate species foil the despotic distribution	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Interspecific competition; Dominance; Habitat use; Producer-scrounger; Vultures	MASAI-MARA ECOSYSTEM; POPULATION TRENDS; FORAGING SUCCESS; VULTURES; KENYA; FOOD; DISTURBANCE; CARCASSES; LIVESTOCK; COMPETITION	Trade-offs in species' traits can mediate competition and enable coexistence. A key challenge in ecology is understanding the role of species' trade-offs in maintaining diversity, and evolutionary trade-offs between the abilities of competing species are best understood by considering how competitive advantages change along an environmental gradient. Previous studies of such trade-offs are generally limited to two-species systems and a single trade-off. In this study, I consider the effect of trade-offs in search efficiency and competitive abilities on habitat use patterns among a diverse avian scavenger guild. I hypothesize that species' dominance status and search efficiency will both be correlated with patch quality. Using counts of searching birds in areas that vary in habitat quality in terms of both wildlife and human settlement density and observations at experimental carcasses, I assess the competitive ability, search efficiency, and habitat use of seven avian scavenger species in Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. Findings support the hypothesis with Bateleurs, a species with high search efficiency, and Ruppell's, Lappet-faced, and White-backed vultures, species with high individual or social dominance, preferentially exploiting habitats of high quality, while Tawny eagles and Hooded vultures, species with low search efficiency and competitive ability, prefer habitats of low quality. This paper demonstrates the importance of considering multiple strategies for assessing the effect of competition on habitat use within complex communities.

Social information use and social learning in non-grouping fishes	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						copying; learning; producer-scrounger; social information; social learning	STICKLEBACKS; CHOICE; CUES	Although it is natural to expect that group-living animals will utilize social learning, the expectation for non-grouping species is less clear. Only a few studies have explored the relationship between sociality and social learning. Here we presented 4 non-grouping fish species, fifteenspine sticklebacks (Spinachia spinachia), bullhead sculpins (Cottus gobio), stone loach (Barbatula barbatula) and juvenile European flounders (Platichthys flesus) with social information provided by groups of a shoal-forming heterospecific, the three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Using a binary choice procedure we allowed individual test subjects to select between simulated prey patches. Although the test subjects could not sample the patches directly they were able to use information generated by the heterospecific demonstrators to select the "richer" of the 2 patches. For comparison we also recorded social information use in 2 shoaling species, threespine, and ninespine sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius). We saw evidence of social information use and social learning in all 6 species, with no differences seen between social and non-grouping species. We argue that social learning is not likely to be restricted to group-living species, since many solitary species too are regularly exposed to social stimuli from both conspecifics and heterospecifics, and can benefit from using social information. We suggest that researchers have much to learn about the sensory, perceptive, and cognitive mechanisms underlying social learning, and the extent to which these vary (if at all) between grouping and non-grouping species.

Among these parameters, the maximum pursuit distance parameter plays an important role because it determines the step length of the producer and rangers of the GSO algorithm. In this paper, we develop a modified GSO algorithm by using the success rate model to adjust the maximum pursuit distance parameter of the algorithm. We test the proposed algorithm on a rich set of benchmark functions including 30- and 300-dimensional problems and compare the results with popular evolutionary and swarm algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the scanning mechanism of the proposed algorithm quickly optimises not only the 30-dimensional problems but also the high-dimensional (300D) problems.

Reproductive state affects reliance on public information in sticklebacks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						social learning; transmission; diffusion; foraging; producer-scrounger; group	SOCIAL-LEARNING STRATEGIES; MALE 3-SPINED STICKLEBACK; GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS; PREDATION RISK; THREESPINE STICKLEBACKS; ACQUIRED INFORMATION; SELECTIVE PREDATION; ADAPTIVE USE; HABITAT USE; BEHAVIOR	The degree to which animals use public and private sources of information has important implications for research in both evolutionary ecology and cultural evolution. While researchers are increasingly interested in the factors that lead individuals to vary in the manner in which they use different sources of information, to date little is known about how an animal's reproductive state might affect its reliance on social learning. Here, we provide experimental evidence that in foraging ninespine sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius), gravid females increase their reliance on public information generated by feeding demonstrators in choosing the richer of two prey patches than non-reproductive fish, while, in contrast, reproductive males stop using public information. Subsequent experiments revealed reproductive males to be more efficient asocial foragers, less risk-averse and generally less social than both reproductive females and non-reproductives. These findings are suggestive of adaptive switches in reliance on social and asocial sources of information with reproductive condition, and we discuss the differing costs of reproduction and the proximate mechanisms that may underlie these differences in information use. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of adaptive foraging strategies in animals and for understanding the way information diffuses through populations.	[Webster, M.

The algorithm is based on the Producer-Scrounger model [1], which assumes group members search either for 'finding' (producer) or for 'joining' (scrounger) opportunities. Animal scanning mechanisms (e.g., vision) are incorporated to develop the algorithm. We also employ 'rangers' which perform random walks to avoid entrapment in local minima. When tested against benchmark functions, GSO outperformed competitively with other evolutionary algorithms in terms of accuracy and convergence speed on most of the benchmark functions.

The Learning Mechanism Underlying Public Information Use in Ninespine Sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius)	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						diffusion; producer-scrounger; social learning; social information; social transmission	FOOD PREFERENCES; ADAPTIVE USE; ANIMALS; SITES; TRANSMISSION; STRATEGIES; EXPERIENCE; INSIGHTS; BEHAVIOR; FISH	Elucidating the mechanisms by which animals learn from others is central to understanding the evolution of behavioral adaptations and the constraints that limit options when gathering information about the environment. Here we, present findings from three experiments that investigated the psychological mechanisms underlying public-information use in ninespine sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius). Using a prey patch choice assay we compared two candidate processes, local enhancement and stimulus enhancement. These experiments revealed (a) that fish only selected socially demonstrated prey patches via local enhancement, (b) that even in the absence of any confounding influence of local enhancement there was no evidence for stimulus enhancement in patch choice, and (c) sensitization rather than associative learning underlies the observed public information use. Our findings suggest that local and stimulus enhancement are distinct processes, and that local enhancement is not merely a subcategory of stimulus enhancement, as has previously been argued in the literature. We offer several reasons why learning via stimulus enhancement may not have arisen in ninespine sticklebacks, and speculate that the evolution of this learning mechanism may be favored by specific properties of social structure.

Kleptoparasitic Interactions under Asymmetric Resource Valuation	MATHEMATICAL MODELLING OF NATURAL PHENOMENA			English	Article						stealing; resource holding potential; game theory; Producer-Scrounger game	EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; DEFENSE	We introduce a game theoretical model of stealing interactions. We model the situation as an extensive form game when one individual may attempt to steal a valuable item from another who may in turn defend it. The population is not homogeneous, but rather each individual has a different Resource Holding Potential (RHP). We assume that RHP not only influences the outcome of the potential aggressive contest (the individual with the larger RHP is more likely to win), but that it also influences how an individual values a particular resource. We investigate several valuation scenarios and study the prevalence of aggressive behaviour. We conclude that the relationship between RHP and resource value is crucial, where some cases lead to fights predominantly between pairs of strong individuals, and some between pairs of weak individuals. Other cases lead to no fights with one individual conceding, and the order of strategy selection is crucial, where the individual which picks its strategy first often has an advantage.

The proportion of food eaten before the arrival of conspecifics, the finder's share, is hypothesized to play a major role in shaping group geometry, foraging strategy, and feeding competition. The variables that affect the finder's share in ring-tailed coatis were tested using a series of food trials. The number of grapes in the food trials had a strong negative effect on the finder's share and the probability that the finder was joined. The effect of group size on the finder's share and foraging success was not straightforward and was mediated by sociospatial factors. The finder's share increased when the time to arrival of the next individual was longer, the group was more spread out, and the finder was in the back of the group. Similarly, the total amount of food eaten at a trial was higher when more grapes were placed, arrival time was longer, and the number of joiners was smaller. Individuals at the front edge of the group found far more food trials, but foraging success was higher at the back of the group where there were fewer conspecifics to join them. This study highlights the importance of social spacing strategies and group geometry on animal foraging tactics and the costs and benefits of sociality.

Using information filtered by others is quicker, more efficient and less risky than randomly sampling the environment. To explain the mix of social and individual learning used by animals in nature, most models penalize the quality of socially derived information as either out of date, of poor fidelity or costly to acquire. Competition for limited resources, a fundamental evolutionary force, provides a compelling, yet hitherto overlooked, explanation for the evolution of mixed-learning strategies. We present a novel model of social learning that incorporates competition and demonstrates that (i) social learning is favoured when competition is weak, but (ii) if competition is strong social learning is favoured only when resource quality is highly variable and there is low environmental turnover. The frequency of social learning in our model always evolves until it reduces the mean foraging success of the population. The results of our model are consistent with empirical studies showing that individuals rely less on social information where resources vary little in quality and where there is high within-patch competition. Our model provides a framework for understanding the evolution of social learning, a prerequisite for human cumulative culture.	[Smolla, Marco; Gilman, R.

Both tactics yield equal rewards on average, but the rewards generated by producer are more variable. A dynamic variance-sensitive foraging model predicts that social foragers should increase their use of scrounger with increasing energy requirements and/or decreased food availability early in the foraging period. We tested whether natural variation in minimum energy requirements (basal metabolic rate or BMR) is associated with differences in the use of producer-scrounger foraging tactics in female zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata. As predicted by the dynamic variance-sensitive model, high BMR individuals had significantly greater use of the scrounger tactic compared with low BMR individuals. However, we observed no effect of food availability on tactic use, indicating that female zebra finches were not variance-sensitive foragers under our experimental conditions. This study is the first to report that variation in BMR within a species is associated with differences in foraging behaviour. BMR-related differences in scrounger tactic use are consistent with phenotype-dependent tactic use decisions. We suggest that BMR is correlated with another phenotypic trait which itself influences tactic use decisions.

Experience shapes social information use in foraging fish	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						producer-scrounger; public information; social information; social learning; social transmission	PUBLIC INFORMATION; VIDEO TRACKING; BEHAVIOR; EVOLUTION; STICKLEBACK; PRODUCER	Many species of animal use social information, and in a variety of different contexts, but it is not clear to what degree their ability to do this depends upon their prior experience of the association between the behaviour of others and reward. We addressed this question in an experiment in which two stickleback species (Gasterosteus aculeatus and Punginus punginus) were exposed to a novel feeding task and then tested under a range of conditions. Using a fully factorial training design, fish were fed from either the surface or the bottom of their tank, and at the same time were exposed to conspecifics feeding from the surface or bottom. At test, we showed that in order to be able to use demonstrator behaviour to anticipate the presence of food at the surface, test subjects needed first to have prior experience of both: sticklebacks responded to the behaviour of conspecifics that were feeding at the surface by rising higher in the water column themselves, but, crucially, they only did this if they had prior experience both of finding food at the water surface and of seeing others feed there. Moreover, they only displayed this response in the presence of feeding conspecifics, but not when the demonstrators were not feeding or were absent. The role of prior experience and learning in social information use is surprisingly understudied.

BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						diffusion; local enhancement; producer-scrounger; social learning strategies; social transmission	STRATEGIES; INSIGHTS; ANIMALS; COPY; FISH	If we are to understand the cognitive basis and evolutionary origins of a particular behaviour, it is necessary to identify its underlying mechanism. Ninespine sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) can identify the richer of two prey patches by observing other foragers' success. This may be due to social learning, or an unlearned social effect on travel direction, brought about by the fish being more likely to face and subsequently travel towards areas where they have observed more feeding activity. Here we show that observer orientation does not predict patch choice, and that fish are still more likely to spend more time in richer patches even if they have to take an indirect route to reach them. This suggests that sticklebacks can learn the location of the richer patch through observation, and viewed in conjunction with other published findings, suggests that learned local enhancement lies behind public information use in this species.

INCORPORATING SOCIAL INFORMATION TO IMPROVE THE PRECISION OF MODELS OF AVIAN HABITAT USE	CONDOR			English	Article						aggregation; conspecific attraction; habitat selection; producer-scrounger game; social information	PUBLIC INFORMATION; SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; CONSPECIFIC ATTRACTION; LOCAL ENHANCEMENT; SELECTION; DENSITY; DISPERSAL; BEHAVIOR; POPULATIONS; PREFERENCE	Correlations between habitat measures and animal distributions are not always applicable outside the study area that generated them. In such cases, the particularities of these correlations likely arise because only use of the local habitat has been quantified, rather than actual habitat selection, as the distribution models do not account for the behavior of animals in choice. The addition of covariates accounting for selection strategies could improve the precision and accuracy of correlative models of habitat use, but this conjecture has received little empirical attention. To evaluate this possibility, we re-assess previously developed habitat-use models for abundance of males of three grassland birds by explicitly including two measures of selection behavior: the "propensity to aggregate" and "propensity to use social information." Habitat-use models for Nelson's Sharp-tailed Sparrow (Ammodramus nelsoni) were not improved by either behavioral variable. However, models for two other species, the Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) and Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), improved substantially through reduced prediction error (assessed with cross-validation) and were much more likely to be an appropriate model (by reducing the deviance of the fitted models). These results indicate that habitat-selection models can be an improvement over correlative habitat-use models. In our case, these improvements were limited to two species in which individuals use their conspecifics as cues of local habitat quality. However, numerous other measures of selection behavior can be included to improve upon certain habitat-use models, particularly when those models depart unexplainedly from optimality theory.

This has previously been the subject of a range of modelling approaches, one of which is the so called "producer-scrounger" model. In this model a producer finds a resource that takes some time to be consumed, and some time later a (generally) conspecific scrounger discovers the producer with its resource and potentially attempts to steal it. In this paper we consider a variant of this scenario where each individual can choose to invest an amount of energy into this contest, and the level of investment of each individual determines the probability of it winning the contest, but also the additional cost it has to bear. We analyse the model for a specific set of cost functions and maximum investment levels and show how the evolutionarily stable behaviour depends upon them. In particular we see that for high levels of maximum investment, the producer keeps the resource without a fight for concave cost functions, but for convex functions the scrounger obtains the resource (albeit at some cost).

By following foraging decisions made by beach-foraging crows, we assessed individual variability in strategy use, variables influencing the finder's share (when defined as the probability of retaining a prey item in the presence of food theft behaviour) and the benefits and costs of producing and scrounging. Data were collected using focal and all-occurrences scan sampling. Results indicated that more individuals were likely to use both producing and scrounging tactics than to be 'pure' producers. No pure scroungers were documented. When producers obtained scroungeable items, scroungers attempted to steal the item 46% of the time. Forty-one per cent of attempted scrounges were successful. Thus, producers suffered a 19% loss rate of scroungeable items to scroungers, although producers had access to large numbers of small (nonscroungeable) items. Although there were significantly more scroungeable prey items available at lower tides, there was no significant relationship between prey density and scrounge attempts or actual thefts. No ecological factors (group size, temperature, time of day, season) or individual characteristics (age, sex) influenced the probability of retaining prey. Prey retention was determined only by characteristics of the prey items: larger prey items or those with longer handling times were most likely to be stolen.

In essence, the models predict that increasing economic defendability of a resource should lead to increased frequency of aggression among competitors. We question this prediction because it is based on the assumption that individuals that do not possess a resource and must decide whether to attempt aggressive appropriation of another individual's resource face the same economic decision as those that already have possession of a resource and must decide whether to defend against an appropriator's attack. Using an evolutionary game analysis, we explore how changes in group size, clump density, patch richness, and predation hazards affect both the decision to appropriate and defend a resource and interact to predict effects on the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness of individuals. Our model predicts that increasing group size should result in a dome-shaped response of frequency of aggression and a slight decrease in aggressiveness. Increasing clump density is predicted to increase both the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness while increases in clump richness result in reduced aggressiveness at high richness values and a decelerated increase in the frequency of aggression. Finally, predation risk is predicted to increase the frequency of aggression only slightly but to lead to increases in aggressiveness. We compare these predictions to earlier resource defense models. We conclude that most experimental findings agree with our model's predictions but call for explicit experimental tests of our predictions concerning the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness.

However, the effects of resource depletion have rarely been discussed in the context of sexual selection, even though mate choice typically favours males who outperform others in securing access to some limited resource. Here, we develop a model to investigate the question of resource competition as a form of male-male competition in the context of male sexual displays. We phrase our model in terms of male bowerbirds either searching for or stealing resources (ornamental objects) valued by females, and compare the model findings with published studies of time allocation to various activities in different species of bowerbirds. The basic idea of the model, however, extends to cases where the resource is used less directly for the development of sexual ornamentation, such as males excluding others' access to food. We show that if males compete for resources used in sexual displays, intense female preference for high-quality displays can lead to poorer prospects for efficient choice by females. This is because males benefit from excluding others' access to resources used in displays, damaging the overall efficiency of resource use in the population, and the accuracy with which females can judge male ability to gain such resources. The evolution of female choice may therefore have a self-limiting nature when it poses a selection pressure on male resource acquisition.

In this study we investigated whether archerfish, Toxotes jaculatrix, display any behavioural changes in response to the presence of an audience while using their specialized foraging tactic of shooting, spitting precisely aimed jets of water, at prey targets. As any prey items shot down are potentially available to competitors, we hypothesized that shooting fish would be sensitive to the presence of potential competitors, especially given the suggestion that, in the wild, this species shows intraspecific kleptoparasitism and faces interspecific competition. We found that in the presence of another fish, archerfish took longer to shoot, made more orientations (aiming events) per shot, and tended to be closer to the target at the time of shooting. Additionally, archerfish showed high interindividual differences in latency to shoot, and these differences were consistent across contexts, with and without an audience. Our results show that archerfish are sensitive to, and adjust their shooting behaviour in response to, the presence of an audience and highlight the importance of social context in this fish species. We also suggest that interindividual differences may play an important role in archerfish shooting behaviour. This study highlights the importance of social effects and competition on foraging behaviour and decision making. Further work in this species could explore whether differences in competitive foraging ability are linked to sensitivity to the presence of an audience.

Rogers's question revisited	EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						social learning; cultural transmission; cultural capacities; nonstationary uncertain environment; mean fitness; producer-scrounger dilemma	SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; EVOLUTION; CULTURE	It is often taken for granted that social/cultural learning increases human adaptability, because it allows us to acquire useful information without costly individual learning by trial and error. Rogers [Am. Anthropol. 90 (1988) 819] challenged this common view by a simple analytic model. Assuming a "cultural" population composed of individual learners engaging in costly information search and imitators who just copy another member's behavior, Rogers showed that mean fitness of such a mixed "cultural" population at the evolutionary equilibrium is exactly identical to the mean fitness of an "acultural" population consisting only of individual learners. Rogers's result implies that no special adaptive advantage accrues from social/cultural learning. We revisited this counterintuitive argument through use of an experiment with human subjects, and by a series of evolutionary computer simulations that extended Kameda and Nakanishi [Evol. Hum. Behav. 23 (2002) 373]. The simulation results indicated that, if agents can switch between individual learning and imitation selectively, a "cultural" population indeed outperforms an "acultural" population in mean fitness for a broad range of parameters. An experiment that implemented a nonstationary uncertain environment in a laboratory setting provided empirical support for this thesis. Implications of these findings for cultural capacities and some future directions are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Prey exploited by predators engaged in a PS game could gain by evolving predator evasion tactics that shift the PS equilibrium of their predators towards a larger number of nonsearching scroungers. Prey can achieve this by imposing foraging costs that are specific to predators engaged in the producer strategy. Ye tested whether prey crypsis, a trait that has evolved as a demonstrably efficient strategy against solitary predators, imposed a producer-specific cost to group foragers that shifts PS equilibria towards more scrounging. We exposed four flocks of six nutmeg mannikins, Lonchura punctulata, small granivorous passerines that have been documented to play PS foraging games, to clumps of white millet seeds placed against one of two backgrounds that made them either cryptic or conspicuous. In three of four flocks, foraging under crytic conditions required more time to find food, resulted in more detection errors, had no effect on vigilance but significantly increased the frequency of scroungers at equilibrium. Having socially foraging predators may provide prey with an extra incentive to evolve producer-specific costs such as cryptic coloration.

The principles of elite reservation and random perturbation are first introduced by ISSA. Then, the position (input mask) update formulas of producer, scrounger and scouters are modified to improve the wavefront shaping ability. It is showed that ISSA significantly improves the wavefront shaping performance of focusing and imaging in turbid media compared with the basic sparrow search algorithm (SSA) and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). Therefore, ISSA has the potential to be applied to related research in the future.

Space-use and sociability are not related to public-information use in ninespine sticklebacks	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Behavioural syndrome; Bold-shy; Innovation; Producer-scrounger; Social learning strategies; Temperament	NETWORK-BASED DIFFUSION; BEHAVIORAL SYNDROMES; SOCIAL INFORMATION; THREESPINE STICKLEBACKS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BOLDNESS; PERSONALITY; PUNGITIUS; INSIGHTS; ANIMALS	There has been much recent interest in both public information use, and the evolutionary origins and ecological consequences of animal personalities but surprisingly little integration of these two fields. Personality traits may impact upon the extent to which individuals respond to public information in a number of different ways. As a first step towards addressing some of these questions, in this study, we asked whether personality traits predicted public information use in ninespine sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius). Over a 33-day period, subjects were scored twice for a number of behavioural traits, including measures of activity, exploration and shoaling tendency, and were exposed multiple times to a public information use foraging task, in which they were required to select the richer of two prey patches based upon the foraging success of two demonstrator groups. The repeatable (r = 0.38-0.58) behavioural traits were reduced to two principle components describing space use and sociability. Neither of these was found to be related to either of two measures of public information use. While the personality traits that we considered did not co-vary with public information use in this species, they may well indirectly affect opportunity for exposure to public information, and this is an obvious avenue for further research.

Yet the existence and consequences of such so-called 'speed-accuracy trade-offs' in group-foraging animals remain unexplored. We used group-feeding zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, to determine how search speed affects food detection accuracy and how a potential speed-accuracy trade-off influences feeding success. We found significant between-individual differences in hopping speed as well as evidence that faster individuals were more likely to overlook food, demonstrating the existence of a trade-off between speed and food detection probability. We also found that feeding success was positively predicted by an individual's food detection probability, whereas it was unrelated to hopping speed. These findings have several implications. First, they indicate that social animals, like solitary foragers, may be affected by perhaps universal constraints when foraging, such as limited attention. These constraints may contribute to promote between-individual variation in foraging tactics within social groups. Second, the existence of a speed-accuracy trade-off suggests that between-individual behavioural differences are more likely to come from differential allocation between speed and accuracy than from differences in general intrinsic abilities to exploit food resources. Finally, scramble competition's outcomes are likely to be determined by a combination of foraging abilities that individuals must trade off against one another, calling for an integrative approach of how natural selection shapes interactive behavioural dimensions during foraging.

Individual exploration and selective social learning: balancing exploration-exploitation trade-offs in collective foraging	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE			English	Article						exploration-exploitation; social learning; Levy walks; producer-scrounger; collective problem-solving	GROUP-SIZE; INFORMATION USE; LEVY; PATTERNS; ANIMALS; STRATEGIES; SPACE; MODEL; COMPETITION; EVOLUTION	Search requires balancing exploring for more options and exploiting the ones previously found. Individuals foraging in a group face another trade-off: whether to engage in social learning to exploit the solutions found by others or to solitarily search for unexplored solutions. Social learning can better exploit learned information and decrease the costs of finding new resources, but excessive social learning can lead to over-exploitation and too little exploration for new solutions. We study how these two trade-offs interact to influence search efficiency in a model of collective foraging under conditions of varying resource abundance, resource density and group size. We modelled individual search strategies as Levy walks, where a power-law exponent (mu) controlled the trade-off between exploitative and explorative movements in individual search. We modulated the trade-off between individual search and social learning using a selectivity parameter that determined how agents responded to social cues in terms of distance and likely opportunity costs. Our results show that social learning is favoured in rich and clustered environments, but also that the benefits of exploiting social information are maximized by engaging in high levels of individual exploration. We show that selective use of social information can modulate the disadvantages of excessive social learning, especially in larger groups and when individual exploration is limited. Finally, we found that the optimal combination of individual exploration and social learning gave rise to trajectories with mu approximate to 2 and provide support for the general optimality of such patterns in search. Our work sheds light on the interplay between individual search and social learning, and has broader implications for collective search and problem-solving.

Animal scanning mechanisms (e.g., vision) are incorporated to develop the algorithm. In this paper, we apply the GSO to Artificial Neural Network (ANN) training to further investigate its applicability to real-world problems. The parameters of a 3-layer feed-forward ANN, including connection weights and bias are tuned by the GSO algorithm. Two real-world classification problems have been employed as benchmark problems trained by the ANN, to assess the performance of the GSO-trained ANN (GSOANN). In comparison with other sophisticated machine learning techniques proposed for ANN training in recent years, including some ANN ensembles, GSOANN has a better convergence and generalization performances on the two benchmark problems.

This experiment evaluated the effect of varying the effort required in order to access food upon the acquisition of a novel response, and upon utilizing producer-scrounger strategies, in flocks of pigeons exposed to an expert conspecific. Flocks of naive observers were exposed to a pigeon trained to open the seals on food deposits. The colors of the seals were correlated with differing required efforts. Later, the trained pigeon was removed while the color-effort correlation was maintained. The results showed that the observers acquired the response of opening the seals and that they executed it discriminatingly, responding in a greater proportion to the color that signaled the least required effort. They also assumed the roles of both producers and scroungers, which varied as a function of the composition of the group. The data obtained are congruent with prior findings regarding social learning, and also with the concepts proposed by the optimal foraging theory.

The algorithm is designed to search the Pareto-optimal solutions minimizing the makespan and total flow time for the flow shop scheduling with blocking constraint. In the proposed algorithm, a diversified initial population is constructed based on the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham heuristic and its variants. Unlike the original group search optimizer in which continuous solution representation is used, the proposed algorithm employs discrete job permutation representation to adapt to the considered scheduling problem. Accordingly, operations of producer, scrounger, and ranger are newly designed. An insertion-based Pareto local search is put forward in producer procedure, a crossover operation is introduced in scrounger procedure, and a local search based on the insert neighborhood is designed in ranger procedure. A bunch of computational experiments and results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to two existing powerful meta-heuristics in terms of both inverted generational distance and set coverage.

Group Search Optimizer: An Optimization Algorithm Inspired by Animal Searching Behavior	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Animal behavior; behavioral ecology; evolutionary algorithm; optimization; swarm intelligence	STRATEGIES; ENSEMBLES; MODELS	Nature-inspired optimization algorithms, notably evolutionary algorithms (EAs), have been widely used to solve various scientific and engineering problems because of to their simplicity and flexibility. Here we report a novel optimization algorithm, group search optimizer (GSO), which is inspired by animal behavior, especially animal searching behavior. The framework is mainly based on the producer-scrounger model, which assumes that group members search either for "finding" (producer) or for "joining" (scrounger) opportunities. Based on this framework, concepts from animal searching behavior, e. g., animal scanning mechanisms, are employed metaphorically to design optimum searching strategies for solving continuous optimization problems. When tested against benchmark functions, in low and high dimensions, the GSO algorithm has competitive performance to other EAs in terms of accuracy and convergence speed, especially on high-dimensional multimodal problems. The GSO algorithm is also applied to train artificial neural networks. The promising results on three real-world benchmark problems show the applicability of GSO for problem solving.	[He, S.; Wu, Q.

The success of kleptoparasitism may be influenced by a number of factors, including competitive differences among individuals and the spatial distribution of prey and hosts. I used ideal free distribution (IFD) theory to predict the spatial distribution of kleptoparasites and their hosts between two patches differing in quality and to predict how the use of kleptoparasitism was influenced by the relative searching and fighting abilities of classes of competitors. Unlike previous IFD models incorporating kleptoparasitism, I allowed competitors to choose between attempting kleptoparasitism or searching for undefended prey. When the rates of resource inputs into the patches were high, the model predicted little use of kleptoparasitism. If competitive types were equally able to displace others from resources, then those individuals that were poorer at searching for food were more likely to kleptoparasitize. If competitive types differed in their abilities to displace others, kleptoparasites were exclusively those individuals that were best able to do so. Regardless of their competitive type, a higher proportion of individuals in the high-quality patch were kleptoparasitic,while the total density of competitors in the high-quality patch was lower than that expected based on the ratio of resource inputs. These predictions differ from previous IFD models of kleptoparasitism, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in searching for and obtaining resources can influence the spatial distribution of animals.

Although recent models suggest that the internal state of animals may be particularly important in tactic choice, the effects of state variables on the use of alternative behavioural forms have rarely been demonstrated. In this study, using experimental wind exposure to increase overnight energy expenditure, we show that flock-feeding house sparrows (Passer domesticus) with lowered energy reserves increase their use of scrounging (exploiting others' food findings) during their first feed of the day. This result is in accordance with the prediction of a state-dependent model of use of social foraging tactics. We also show that scrounging provides less variable feeding rates and patch finding times than the alternative tactic. These latter results support the theoretical assumption that scrounging is a risk-averse tactic, i.e. it reduces the risk of immediate starvation. As the level of energy reserves predicts the use of social foraging tactics, we propose that selection should favour individuals that monitor the internal state of flock mates and use this information to adjust their own tactic choice.

Here we consider how social interactions can create unique, evolving patterns in space and time. Whereas simple prey taxis (with consumable prey) promotes spatial uniform distributions, here we show that taxis in producer-scrounger groups can lead to pattern formation. We consider two types of foragers: those that search directly ("producers") and those that exploit other foragers to find food ("scroungers" or exploiters). We show that such groups can sustain fluctuating spatiotemporal patterns, akin to "waves of pursuit." Investigating the relative benefits to the individuals, we observed conditions under which either strategy leads to enhanced success, defined as net food consumption. Foragers that search for food directly have an advantage when food patches are localized. Those that seek aggregations of group mates do better when their ability to track group mates exceeds the foragers' food-sensing acuity. When behavioral switching or reproductive success of the strategies is included, the relative abundance of foragers and exploiters is dynamic over time, in contrast with classic models that predict stable frequencies. Our work shows the importance of considering two-way interaction-i.e., how food distribution both influences and is influenced by social foraging and aggregation of predators.

Phenotypic correlates of scrounging behavior in zebra finches: Role of foraging efficiency and dominance	ETHOLOGY			English	Article							GULLS LARUS-DOMINICANUS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; LONCHURA-PUNCTULATA; CORVUS-CAURINUS; CAPTIVE FLOCKS; JUNCO-HYEMALIS; SPICE FINCHES; FOOD; TACTICS; PRODUCER	In flocks, individuals can search for their own food using the producer tactic or exploit the discoveries of companions using the scrounger tactic. Models of the producer-scrounger game usually assume that tactic payoffs are independent of individual phenotypic traits. However, factors such as dominance status or foraging efficiency may constrain the use of tactics and lead to asymmetric tactic use among individuals. For instance, in flocks composed of foragers with unequal foraging efficiency, foragers that are less efficient at obtaining food are expected to rely on the scrounger tactic to a greater extent. I examined the role of foraging efficiency and dominance status as potential correlates of scrounging behavior in small aviary flocks of zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata). Individual foraging efficiency was documented in each flock in a treatment that prevented scrounging. In a subsequent treatment that allowed scrounging, higher levels of scrounging occurred as predicted in foragers with lower foraging efficiency. Dominance status was a poor predictor of tactic choice. Birds that arrived later on the foraging grid foraged less efficiently when scrounging was prevented and used scrounging to a greater extent when allowed, suggesting a link between boldness, foraging efficiency and the choice of foraging tactics in small flocks of zebra finches.

Risk tolerance predicts behavioral plasticity in cooperation	EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Cooperation; Group productivity; Marginally diminishing returns; Producer-scrounger game; Behavioral plasticity; Risk preference	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; CONDITIONAL COOPERATION; STRATEGY CHOICE; EVOLUTION; GAME; EXPECTATIONS; PREFERENCES; PERSONALITY; MODEL	In collaborations, group productivity typically increases with more cooperators, but is also often subject to diminishing returns. This pattern provides a different view about cooperation from traditional social dilemmas: defection is not necessarily the dominant strategy. Rather, a frequency-dependent "anti-conformist" strategy (cooperate if many others defect, and vice versa) is often individually rational. This study addresses human cooperation under such marginally diminishing group productivity, focusing on the plasticity of cooperative choices. We conducted a two-part "team foraging" experiment, in which the most- or least-cooperative members in the first part were re-grouped separately for the second part. We observed that cooperating and defecting "types" emerged within a group over time but did not completely persist across groups, with some of the most cooperative members switching to become the least cooperative (and vice versa). Risk attitude was a key factor in this switching behavior: greater risk-takers showed greater behavioral plasticity. These results imply that human cooperation may be more context-dependent and behaviorally plastic than previously thought.

EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL VERSUS INDIVIDUAL LEARNING IN AN INFINITE ISLAND MODEL	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Dual inheritance theory; gene-culture coevolution; producer-scrounger game; Rogers' paradox; spatial structure	INCREASE HUMAN ADAPTABILITY; INCLUSIVE FITNESS MODEL; VISCOUS POPULATIONS; SELECTION FAVORS; ANIMAL COGNITION; CULTURE; ENVIRONMENT; STRATEGIES; EMERGENCE; BEHAVIOR	We model the evolution of learning in a population composed of infinitely many, finite-sized islands connected by migration. We assume that there are two discrete strategies, social and individual learning, and that the environment is spatially homogeneous but varies temporally in a periodic or stochastic manner. Using a population-genetic approximation technique, we derive a mathematical condition for the two strategies to coexist stably and the equilibrium frequency of social learners under stable coexistence. Analytical and numerical results both reveal that social learners are favored when island size is large or migration rate between islands is high, suggesting that spatial subdivision disfavors social learners. We also show that the average fecundity of the population under stable coexistence of the two strategies is in general lower than that in the absence of social learners and is minimized at an intermediate migration rate.

TSP has many real world applications and a number of methods have been investigated to solve TSP. Recently, nature inspired algorithms are also attracted to solve it. Here we studied Group Search Optimizer(GSO), the recently proposed nature inspired algorithm, to solve TSP. GSO is a population based optimization technique on the metaphor of producer-scrounger based social behavior of animals where producer searches for finding foods and scrounger searches for joining opportunities. GSO has found as an efficient method for solving function optimization problems for which it modeled. In this study we employ the concept of Swap Operator (SO) and Swap Sequence (SS) to modify GSO for TSP. The modified GSO (mGSO) was tested on a number of benchmark TSPs and results compared with some existing approaches. mGSO has shown best results (best tour cost) for some problems and competitive performance in other cases.

This paper is motivated by the following general observation on mosquito groups and their host-seeking behavior in nature: (1) Mosquitoes' behavior has possession of the parallelism, openness, local interactivity and self-organization. (2) Mosquito groups seek host very fast. (3) The host-seeking behavior is similar to the producer-scrounger process, which assumes that group members search either for "finding" (producer) or for "joining" (scrounger) opportunities. It stimulates us to extend a mosquito system model in nature to group mosquito host-seeking model (GMHSM) and algorithm (GMHSA) for intelligent computing. In this paper, we propose GMHS approach and show how to use it. By GMHSM, the TSP is transformed into the kinematics and dynamics of mosquito groups host-seeking process. The properties of GMHSM and GMHSA, including the correctness, convergence and stability, have been discussed in this paper. The GMHS approach has many advantages in terms of multiple objective optimization, large-scale distributed parallel optimization, effectiveness of problem-solving and suitability for complex environment. Via simulations, we test the GMHS approach and compare it with other state-of-art algorithms.

Researchers have applied various soft computing evolutionary optimization techniques to evolve communities by optimizing modularity. This paper proposes an efficient hybrid evolutionary algorithm TL-GSO which incorporates the exploration and exploitation capabilities of two recently proposed nature inspired algorithms named Improved-Teacher's Learner's Based Optimization (I-TLBO) and Group Search Optimization (GSO) algorithms. The hybridization has resulted in fast convergence to accurate communities as compared to the results of applying GSO with single producer. TL-GSO adapts the strategy of teacher's learners by dividing the search space into small groups and allocating one teacher/producer to each group. Multiple producers improves the fitness of the population more efficiently by independently evolving small scrounger groups in a generation. The producer scrounger (PS) search strategy of GSO is then applied in groups to evolve them locally. Further scroungers behavior is also modified to make them perform single point crossover instead of real coded crossover in order to improve their fitness. The algorithm was tested on four real world datasets and results were compared with evolutionary as well as non-evolutionary state of the art algorithms. The results shows the effectiveness of proposed TL-GSO algorithm over many state of the art algorithms.

Producers and scroungers: feeding-type composition changes with group size in a socially foraging spider	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						behavioural type; feeding tactics; group size; scrounging; social foraging	DIVISION-OF-LABOR; PREDATION RISK; BEHAVIORAL SYNDROMES; RELATEDNESS; VALIDATION; EFFICIENCY; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; TACTICS; FITNESS	In groups of socially foraging animals, feeding behaviour may change with group size in response to varying cost benefit trade-offs. Numerous studies have described group-size effects on group-average feeding behaviour, particularly emphasizing an increase in scrounging incidence for larger groups, where individuals (scroungers) feed from the food sources others (producers) discovered. However, individual variation in feeding behaviour remains unconsidered in the vast majority of these studies even though theoretical models predict individuals to specialize in feeding tactic and anticipate higher scrounger-type frequencies in larger groups. We combined group level and individual-level analyses of group-size effects on social foraging in the subsocial spider Australomisidia ergandros. Lending novel experimental support to model predictions, we found that individuals specialize in feeding tactic and that higher scrounging and lower producing incidence in larger groups were mediated through shifts in the ratio of feeding types. Further, feeding-type specialization was not explained by innate individual differences in hunting ability as all feeding types were equally efficient in prey capture when foraging alone. Context adaptivity of feeding behaviour might allow this subsocial species to succeed under varying socioecological conditions.

In social spiders, siblings share prey and may both compete and cooperate to obtain this resource. In the laboratory, the social huntsman spider, Delena cancerides, readily shares prey captured by other colony members; however, these spiders only occasionally share prey in the field, making the importance of prey sharing to their social system difficult to assess directly. We examined the importance of prey sharing indirectly by measuring the body condition of spiders from 90 colonies at the time of collection. We compared body condition to colony demographics to determine whether the patterns were consistent with the hypothesis that younger spiders benefit from sharing prey captured by older siblings. We tested several alternative hypotheses that might also explain associations between condition and the presence of siblings. We further conducted a laboratory experiment to directly determine whether feeding on prey captured by older siblings improves the condition of younger spiders. Younger spiders collected from the field were heavier in the presence of older siblings, but there was no effect for older spiders or for any spider with younger siblings. Laboratory spiders gained access to additional prey captured by older siblings. We rejected the alternative hypotheses and concluded that younger spiders indeed benefit from the presence of older siblings.

J	Chen, DB; Wang, JT; Zou, F; Hou, WB; Zhao, CX				Chen, Debao; Wang, Jiangtao; Zou, Feng; Hou, Weibo; Zhao, Chunxia			An improved group search optimizer with operation of quantum-behaved swarm and its application	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Group search optimizer (GSO); Evolutionary algorithms (EAs); Improved GSO algorithm (IGSO); Single multiplicative neuron model; Quantum-behaved particle swarm; optimization (QPSO)	TIME-SERIES PREDICTION; DESIGN OPTIMIZATION; PARTICLE; MODEL	Group search optimizer (GSO) is a novel swarm intelligent (SI) algorithm for continuous optimization problem. The framework of the algorithm is mainly based on the producer-scrounger (PS) model. Comparing with ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, GSO emphasizes more on imitating searching behavior of animals. In standard GSO algorithm, more than 80% individuals are chosen as scroungers, and the producer is the one and only destination of them. When the producer cannot found a better position than the old one in some successive iterations, the scroungers will almost move to the same place, the group might be trapped into local optima though a small quantity of rangers are used to improve the diversity of it. To improve the convergence performance of GSO, an improved GSO optimizer with quantum-behaved operator for scroungers according to a certain probability is presented in the paper. In the method, the scroungers are divided into two parts, the scroungers in the first part update their positions with the operators of QPSO, and the remainders keep searching for opportunities to join the resources found by the producer. The operators of QPSO are utilized to improve the diversity of population for GSO. The improved GSO algorithm (IGSO) is tested on several benchmark functions and applied to train single multiplicative neuron model. The results of the experiments indicate that IGSO is competitive to some other EAs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Collective risk-monitoring in groups	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						risk-monitoring; foraging; cooperation; free-riding; producer-scrounger game; uncertainty; information cascade; behavioral ecology	INFORMATION CASCADES; TRADE-OFF; VIGILANCE; DECISION; ENVIRONMENT; PERCEPTION; BEHAVIOR; SEX	The importance of risk-monitoring has been increasing in many key aspects of our modern lives. This paper examines how individuals monitor such risks collectively by extending a behavioral ecological model of animal foraging to human groups. Just as animals must forage for food under predatory risk, humans must divide valuable material and psychological resources between foraging activity and risk-monitoring activity. We predicted that game-theoretic aspects of the group situation complicate such a trade-off decision in resource allocation, eventually yielding a mixed equilibrium in a group. When the equilibrium is reached, only a subset of members engage in the risk-monitoring activity while others free-ride, concentrating mainly on their own foraging activity. Laboratory groups engaging in foraging under moderate risk provided a support to this prediction, When the risk-level was set higher, however, "herding behavior" (conforming to the dominant behavior) interfered with the emergence of equilibrium. Implications for risk management are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Sharing among kin may increase indirect fitness [1], but when non-kin are involved, different mechanisms were suggested to act. Occasionally, "tolerated theft" [2, 3] is observed, merely because defending a resource is not cost effective. Sharing may also be explained as "costly signaling" [4, 5], where individuals signal their high qualities by distributing acquired resources, as has been suggested to occur in certain human cultures [6]. Alternatively, a transferred food item might be compensated for in later interactions [7]. In vampire bats, blood sharing reflects reciprocity between non-kin colony members [8-10], and long-term social bonds affect food sharing in chimpanzees [11]. Food may also be exchanged for other goods or social benefits [12-14]. One reciprocity-based explanation for intersexual food sharing is the food-for-sex hypothesis [15-17]. This hypothesis proposes that males share food with females in exchange for mating opportunities. Studies on human hunter-gatherer societies suggest that males with increased foraging success have higher reproductive success [18, 19]. Male chimpanzees, which in contrast to humans do not maintain pair bonds, were suggested to share food with females to increase their mating opportunities [16] (but see [20]). Bats, which are long-lived social mammals [21, 22], provide an opportunity to study long-term social reciprocity mechanisms. We monitored producer-scrounger interactions of a captive Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) colony for more than a year and genetically determined the paternity of the pups that were born in the colony. We found that females carry the young of males from which they used to scrounge food, supporting the food-for-sex hypothesis in this species.

To solve this highly constrained multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP), a multiple group search optimization based on decomposition (MGSO/D) is proposed considering the uncertainties of PEVs and wind power. Specifically, the decomposition approach effectively reduces the computational complexity, and the innovatively incorporated producer-scrounger model effectively improves the diversity and spanning of the Pareto-optimal front (PF). Meanwhile, the estimation error punishment is utilized to take into account of uncertainties. The performance of MGSO/D and the effectiveness of the uncertainty model are investigated on the IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus system with wind farms and PEV aggregators. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of MGSO/D to solve this MOOP with practical uncertainties by comparing with well-established Pareto heuristic methods.

It's a professional and efficient way to select a suitable service from each type of services to form a unified system of "one-stop" service for the user. D-GSS method is presented to match services' QoS with users' QoS requirements. A key challenge is how to enhance the efficiency of D-GSS method. Therefore, an improved discrete group search service (ID-GSS) is presented in this paper. The framework is mainly based on the producer scrounger-ranger model. A min-cost function is presented in this paper to help all members in the group to find their respective approximate optimal solutions at each iteration more quickly. Thus ID-GSS has faster convergence speed than D-GSS. We study the convergence of ID-GSS method through verification and simulations.

We shall show that among equal competitors the optimal patch time for the individual that finds the food patch is shorter than that for the non-finder among equal competitors, T-E < T-N. This is the case if the patch-finder commences food harvesting in the patch earlier and manages to monopolise a fraction of the prey items (finder's advantage) before the other individuals come to take their benefit. When individuals differ in their food-searching abilities so that some of them (producers) contribute proportionally more to food-searching than others (scroungers), and differ in ability to compete for the food found, a difference emerges between producer and scrounger individuals in the optimal patch time. Within a patch we always have the finder's advantage (T-E < T-N) regardless of phenotype. Between patches a suite of optimal patch times for encountering individuals emerges depending on the performance of producers and scroungers when changing from solitary feeding to feeding in a group. The optimal patch time for individuals that are affected more severely by competition is shorter than that for individuals of the phenotype with better competitive ability. When both phenotypes are affected similarly no difference in optimal patch times emerges.

We used two groups, each di seven male birds, labelled 'fast' and 'slow' explorers based on previous studies in which consistent individual differences in the speed of exploring were found. The birds were trained to search for food hidden in a number of differently coloured and shaped feeders, and later to search in only one type of feeder. During the tests, food was absent and the birds were observed in two different situations: alone or in the presence of a tutor, a bird that had been trained to feed in a different kind of feeder. When alone, slow birds readily extended their search to other feeders while fast birds did not change their routine of visiting the previously rewarded ones. In the presence of the tutor, the opposite occurred: slow birds did not change their behaviour while fast birds significantly increased their visits to the feeders indicated by the tutor. Fast and slow individuals thus differ in their foraging and copying behaviour, consistent with the producer-scrounger model. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Public information permits faster and more accurate estimates of patch resource densities, thus allowing more effective foraging. In this paper we report on two experiments with red knots Calidris canutus, socially foraging shorebirds that eat bivalves on intertidal mudflats. The first experiment was designed to show that red knots are capable of using public information, and whether dominance status or sex affected its use. We showed that knots can detect the foraging success of conspecifics and choose a patch accordingly. Neither dominance status nor sex influenced public information use. In the second experiment, by manipulating group size, we investigated whether public information use affected food-patch discovery rates and patch residence times. We showed that the time needed before locating a food patch decreased in proportion to group size. Also, an individual's number of patch visits before locating the food declined with group size, and, to our surprise, their average patch residence time did as well. Moreover, knots differed in their search strategy in that some birds consistently exploited the searching efforts of others. We conclude that socially foraging knots have the potential to greatly increase their food-finding rate by using public information.

Despite the typically higher cost of individual learning, there are mechanisms that allow stable coexistence of both learning modes in a single population. In this paper, we investigate by means of mathematical modeling how the effect of spatial structure on evolutionary outcomes of pure social and individual learning strategies depends on the mechanisms for coexistence. We model a spatially structured population based on the infinite-island framework and consider three scenarios that differ in coexistence mechanisms. Using the inclusive-fitness method, we derive the equilibrium frequency of social learners and the genetic load of social learning (defined as average fecundity reduction caused by the presence of social learning) in terms of some summary statistics, such as relatedness, for each of the three scenarios and compare the results. This comparative analysis not only reconciles previous models that made contradictory predictions as to the effect of spatial structure on the equilibrium frequency of social learners but also derives a simple mathematical rule that determines the sign of the genetic load (i.e. whether or not social learning contributes to the mean fecundity of the population).

Although conspecifics can provide cues as to the spatial location of food patches, individual foraging decisions also must include some assessment of the likelihood of obtaining access to a resource other group members seek. This likelihood differs in the 2 models generally proposed to explain intragroup social foraging: the information-sharing model and the producer-scrounger model. We conducted an experimental field study on wild groups of emperor (Saguinus imperator) and saddleback (S. fuscicollis) tamarins to determine the foraging strategies adopted by individual group members and their relationship to social rank, food intake, and the ability to use ecological and social information in making intra-patch foraging decisions. Individual tamarins applied different behavioral strategies compatible with a finder-joiner paradigm to solve foraging problems. About half of the individuals in each study group initiated 74%-90% of all food searches and acted as finders. Most alpha individuals adopted a joiner strategy by monitoring the activities of others' to obtain a reward. The individual arriving first at a reward platform enjoyed a finder's advantage. Despite differences in search effort, both finders and joiners presented similar abilities in learning to associate ecological cues with the presence of food rewards at our experimental feeding stations. We conclude that within a group foraging context, tamarins integrate social and ecological information in decision-making.

Local enhancement via eavesdropping on courtship displays in male guppies, Poecilia reticulata	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						communication network; guppy; mate choice copying; Poecilia reticulata; producer-scrounger; public information; social information; social transmission	SOCIAL-LEARNING STRATEGIES; NETWORK-BASED DIFFUSION; PUBLIC INFORMATION; ADAPTIVE USE; NEIGHBORS; PREDATION; INSIGHTS; FEMALES; FISH; COPY	Courtship interactions often take place within the setting of a communication network, with signals sent from senders to target receivers also being detectable to third-party eavesdroppers. Potentially, eavesdropping males may be able to use signals produced by courting males to locate females indirectly. Furthermore, where male courtship vigour varies according to the quality of females (e. g. fecundity, receptivity or number), eavesdroppers observing multiple courting males may be able to use differences in courtship vigour to gauge indirectly the relative quality of the females. We tested these predictions in an experiment in which observer male guppies were presented with a binary choice between two demonstrator males courting differently sized groups of females, which were hidden from the observer. We found that the demonstrator males courted larger groups of females at a higher rate, and that observer males tested in the presence of the demonstrators spent more time and performed more courtship displays in the location of the demonstrator courting the larger group of females. Observers tested after the demonstrator males had been removed, however, showed no preference for either of the demonstrated locations and for the most part performed no courtship displays at all. Our results provide evidence for male-male local enhancement, but not delayed local enhancement, via demonstrator male courtship behaviour. Such behaviour may be adaptive, allowing eavesdropping observer males to locate females indirectly. We discuss how this system could be employed to explore social transmission of information further.

Cloud consists of a collection of virtual machines (VMs), which includes both computational and storage facility. In this paper, a task scheduling scheme on diverse computing systems using a hybridization of genetic and group search optimization (GGSO) algorithm is proposed. The basic idea of our approach is to exploit the advantages of both genetic algorithm (GA) and group search optimization algorithms (GSO) while avoiding their drawbacks. In GGSO, each dimension of a solution symbolizes a task, and a solution, as a whole, signifies all task priorities. The important issue is how to assign user tasks to maximize the income of infrastructure as a service (Iaas) provider while promising quality of service (QoS). The generated solution is competent to assure user-level (QoS) and improve Iaas providers' credibility and economic benefit. The GGSO method also designs the producer, scrounger ranger, crossover operator, and suitable fitness function of the corresponding task. According to the evolved results, it has been found that our algorithm always outperforms the traditional algorithms.

Individuals in many social species are attracted to feeding conspecifics. The profitability of conspecific attraction is negatively frequency-dependent and can be modelled as a producer-scrounger (PS) game for which the ESS solution predicts some mixture of producer (no attraction) and scrounger (attraction) tactics in the population. Current models for the spatial distribution of rate-maximizing foragers, which learn the quality of habitats as they exploit patches, ignore the possible effect of conspecific attraction on the stable distribution of foragers. 2, We used simulations of a population with ESS levels of attraction to investigate the effect of conspecific attraction on the spatial distribution of learning foragers which incur travel costs. In habitats where patches depleted slowly, ESS levels of attraction helped foragers which experienced no interference reach the expected ideal free distribution (IFD) by facilitating aggregation to the richest patches. Large aggregations also occurred with interference and thus reduced the fit to the IFD, which in this case predicts a scatter of foragers across patches of varying quality. 3. In habitats where patches depleted rapidly, ESS levels of attraction prevented foragers from reaching the IFD, irrespective of interference levels. Foragers failed to learn habitat quality and thus often aggregated in poor patches, especially in large populations which depleted patches faster and had fewer opportunities to learn quality. 4. Predictions of the model in habitats where patches deplete slowly are supported by several studies. More work is needed for habitats where patches deplete more rapidly. We conclude that conspecific attraction can have important, and often disruptive effects on spatial distributions.

Confusion, overshadowing and frequency-dependent payoffs may all contribute to the inhibition, but standard experimental procedures make the separation of these effects difficult. In this study, we combine characteristics of cage and aviary experiments and present either a single naive pigeon or groups of three naive pigeons with a pre-trained producer opening an apparatus in an aviary. All naive birds scrounged on the 3456 openings they witnessed. In a post-test given in the absence of other birds, all single scroungers opened the apparatus, bur only one of the group-scrounging pigeons did. Scrounger numbers appear to play an important role in the inhibition of food-finding behaviour, suggesting that confusion is a major component of learning in a social context.

J	Beauchamp, G				Beauchamp, Guy			A spatial model of producing and scrounging	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						genetic algorithm; group size; producing and scrounging; self-organization; spatial model	GROUP-SIZE; LONCHURA-PUNCTULATA; INFORMATION-CENTERS; FORAGING TACTICS; NUTMEG MANNIKINS; CAPTIVE FLOCKS; GAME; DOMINANCE; VIGILANCE; PATCHES	When foraging in groups, foragers in producer mode search for food independently and foragers in scrounger mode search for opportunities to join the food discoveries of other companions. Producer-scrounger ( PS) models predict that at equilibrium scrounging will increase with group size and with patch richness but will be independent of food patch encounter rate. Earlier PS models assume that foragers arrive instantaneously at scrounged food patches, which is not realistic at the habitat level, at which food patches can be far apart. Here, I develop a spatially explicit model of producing and scrounging in which individuals pay a time cost when travelling to scrounged food patches and may join patches with little or no food left when they arrive. Using a genetic-algorithm approach, I confirm that scrounging increases with patch richness and add several novel predictions. In particular, scrounging is expected to increase with a decrease in food patch encounter rate and can actually decrease when forager density is high. In habitats in which food intake rate increases with the number of foragers at food patches, scrounging at low forager densities is actually predicted to increase success. The spatial model also highlights the self-organizing nature of scrounging. Because scrounging reduces the average distance between foragers, thus reducing the costs of joining, attempts to scrounge make further scrounging more likely to evolve. The spatial model of producing and scrounging provides novel insights into the evolution of group foraging. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Liker, A; Barta, Z				Liker, A; Barta, Z			The effects of dominance on social foraging tactic use in house sparrows	BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							PASSER-DOMESTICUS; CAPTIVE FLOCKS; BADGE SIZE; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; COST; HYPOTHESIS; HIERARCHY; FINCHES; SUCCESS	We investigated whether social foraging tactic use (producing and scrounging) in birds is affected by the dominance rank of individuals as predicted by a phenotype limited producer-scrounger game. In a captive flock of house sparrows, we observed the behaviour of the birds when they were foraging on a grid containing clumps of seeds. We measured the fighting success of the birds, determined the method by which they found food clumps (finding or joining), and measured their feeding rate. Joining were frequently observed and usually involved aggressive interactions. Most birds used both finding and joining to obtain food. We found that foraging method was related to dominance: the frequency of joining gradually increased with increasing dominance rank, as predicted by the phenotype limited model for flocks where there are moderate competitive asymmetries among the birds. Food intake rate of individuals was not related to either their dominance rank or foraging method. Similar weak relationships were predicted by the model among these variables for flocks with moderate competitive asymmetries. Behavioural variability among sparrows in locomotion frequency and vigilance was not related to their foraging method, but the rate of investigating potential food caches strongly decreased with increasing frequency of joining. We conclude that the phenotype limited model successfully predicts the relationship between dominance and joining frequency in house sparrows feeding on concentrated food sources, and we suggest that the distribution of food used in tests of the model may crucially affect their results.

In LETLBO, two random possibilities are used to determine the learning methods of learners in different phases. In the Teacher Phase, the learners improve their grades by utilizing the mean information of the class and the learning experience of other learners according to a random probability. In Learner Phase, the learner learns knowledge from another learner which is randomly selected from the whole class or the mutual learning experience of two randomly selected learners according to a random probability. Moreover, area copying operator which is used in Producer-Scrounger model is used for parts of learners to increase its learning speed. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are tested on 18 benchmark functions and two practical optimization problems. The merits of the improved method are compared with those of some other evolutionary algorithms (EAs), the results show that the proposed algorithm is an effective method for global optimization problems.

Game theory applied to kleptoparasitic populations with food sharing	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						ESS; evolutionary games; food stealing; strategy; social foraging	STOCHASTIC-MODELS; ENERGETIC COST; GROUP-SIZE; BEHAVIOR; INTERFERENCE; EVOLUTION; DEFENSE; CONSEQUENCES; SCROUNGERS; PREDATORS	Animals adopt varied foraging tactics in order to survive. Kleptoparasitism, where animals attempt to steal food already discovered by others, is very common among animal species. In this situation, depending on the ecological conditions, challenged animals might defend, share, or even retreat and leave their food to the challenger. A key determinant of the likely behavior is the nature of the food itself. If food is discovered in divisible clumps, it can be divided between animals in a number of ways. This is the general assumption in one type of game-theoretical model of food stealing, producer-scrounger models. Alternatively, food items may be essentially indivisible, so that sharing is impossible and either the attacker or the defender must retain control of all of the food. This is the assumption of the alternative game-theoretical models of kleptoparasitism. In this paper, using a game-theoretic approach, we relax this assumption of indivisibility and introduce the possibility of limited food sharing behavior between animals in kleptoparasitic populations. Considering the conditions under which food sharing is likely to be common, it is shown that food sharing should occur in a wide range of ecological conditions. In particular, if food availability is limited, the sharing process does not greatly reduce the short-term consumption rate of food and food defense has a high cost and/or a low probability of success, then the use of the food sharing strategy is beneficial. Thus, the assumption of the indivisibility of food items is an important component of previous models.

Behavioural specialization and learning in social networks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						behavioural consistency; animal personality; reinforcement learning; game theory	MIXED STRATEGY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NATTERJACK TOAD; DYNAMICS; SATELLITES; CALLERS; ANURANS; ECOLOGY; GAMES; MODEL	Interactions in social groups can promote behavioural specialization. One way this can happen is when individuals engage in activities with two behavioural options and learn which option to choose. We analyse interactions in groups where individuals learn from playing games with two actions and negatively frequency-dependent payoffs, such as producer-scrounger, caller-satellite, or hawk-dove games. Group members are placed in social networks, characterized by the group size and the number of neighbours to interact with, ranging from just a few neighbours to interactions between all group members. The networks we analyse include ring lattices and the much-studied small-world networks. By implementing two basic reinforcement-learning approaches, action-value learning and actor-critic learning, in different games, we find that individuals often show behavioural specialization. Specialization develops more rapidly when there are few neighbours in a network and when learning rates are high. There can be learned specialization also with many neighbours, but we show that, for action-value learning, behavioural consistency over time is higher with a smaller number of neighbours. We conclude that frequency-dependent competition for resources is a main driver of specialization. We discuss our theoretical results in relation to experimental and field observations of behavioural specialization in social situations.

In this study we explore the effect of social interactions on the foraging path, in particular the distance moved between patches. We studied Bewick's Swans Cygnus columbianus bewicku that foraged on belowground tubers of Fennel Pondweed Potamogeton pectinatus. We accurately mapped the foraging path of individual swans and determined the distances between visited patches. 24% of inter-patch movements are associated with social interactions. When a swan retreats from a patch because it is chased away by another swan, it moves a significantly larger distance to a patch than if the movement is not associated with a social interaction. Such longer movements are thought to reduce the rate at which high-density patches are encountered, and thus the energy gain rate a swan can achieve. We observed a strong social hierarchy in which families are dominant over pairs and singletons, and pairs are dominant over singletons, which represents a producer-scrounger model. Singletons were most frequently observed to retreat from patches and are consequently thought to achieve the lowest gain rates. However singletons might partly compensate for more frequent retreats from patches by moving larger distances to arrive at the front edge of a flock where they encounter unexploited resources.

J	Kobayashi, Y; Wakano, JY; Ohtsuki, H				Kobayashi, Yutaka; Wakano, Joe Yuichiro; Ohtsuki, Hisashi			Evolution of cumulative culture for niche construction	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Dual inheritance theory; Triple inheritance; Gene-culture coevolution; Cultural niche construction	LEARNING SCHEDULES; POPULATIONS; MODEL; CONSEQUENCES; SELECTION; FITNESS; COEVOLUTION; DEMOGRAPHY; ALTRUISM; DYNAMICS	A mathematical model of the joint evolution of learning and niche construction in a spatially subdivided population is described, in which culture is used to practice niche construction and can evolve by accumulating small improvements over generations. Individuals allocate their lifetimes to social learning, individual learning, niche construction to improve the environment, and exploitation of resources according to their genetically determined strategies. The coordinated optimal strategy (COS) is defined as the allocation strategy which maximizes the equilibrium fecundity of the population, as opposed to the convergence stable strategy (CSS), which is the strategy favored by natural selection. Both the COS and CSS are analytically derived and compared. It turns out that, although the levels of the CSS in terms of culture and the environmental quality can be high in a highly viscous population, they are in general much lower than those of the COS. It is argued that the discrepancy between the CSS and COS stems from the producer-scrounger structure inherent in the model. Analysis of transient dynamics reveals that the level of culture and the environmental quality may temporarily undergo drastic increases after sudden changes in parameter values, although they eventually drop down to low values due to the genetic adaptation of the time allocation strategy to the new cultural and environmental backgrounds. Implications of the results for human evolution are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Di Bitetti, MS; Janson, CH				Di Bitetti, MS; Janson, CH			Social foraging and the finder's share in capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							INDIVIDUAL SPATIAL CHOICE; CAPTIVE FLOCKS; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; EXPLOITATION; DOMINANCE; SUCCESS	Group living can confer advantages to individuals, but it can also impose severe costs through resource competition. Kleptoparasitism is one example in which some individuals (joiners) can exploit the food discovered by other animals (finders). This type of social foraging has been modelled either as an information-sharing model or as a producer-scrounger game. An important variable in these models is the finder's advantage: the number of items obtained by the finder before the arrival of other individuals. In this study we describe how the spatial position and rank of individuals in a group of wild tufted capuchin monkeys affect their ability to discover and exploit new food sources. We also analyse the factors that affect the finder's share and the total amount of food obtained by the finder from a newly discovered resource. By placing platforms filled with bananas at novel locations in their home range, we show that animals in the leading edge of a foraging group have a higher probability of discovering new food sources than animals occupying other spatial positions. The alpha male and the alpha female, which tended to occupy central-forward positions, were able to monopolize newly discovered food sources and thus obtain a major share of them. The finder's share at the feeding platforms was smaller when there was more food on a platform, but increased with longer delays before the arrival of other individuals. The total amount of food obtained by the finder from the feeding platforms was larger when there was more food on the platform, when the finder was of higher social status, and when it took longer for other individuals to arrive. Animals can increase their finder's share and total amount consumed from a newly discovered resource by keeping large interindividual distances and by avoiding giving cues about the presence of food (such as food-associated vocalizations) to other animals.

Its evolution has typically been attributed to the resulting increased prey capture rate. Indeed, many studies have documented positive correlations between the number of individuals and probability of success, suggesting that joint hunting is cooperative. However, all existing data on vertebrates are based on field observations and hence cannot control for factors that may also influence hunting success, such as variation in habitat structure, hunting motivation or prey state. Therefore, we conducted controlled laboratory experiments to test whether hunting performance is affected by group size in the grouphunting yellow saddle goatfish. We presented invertebrate prey in an artificial coral reef and measured hunting performance as a function of manipulated group size, ranging from one to four individuals. We found that individuals hunting alone failed to catch the prey within the trial time limit significantly more often than groups did. Furthermore, we found that time until capture depended on group size, with singletons being slowest and groups of four fastest. With few exceptions, group members were approximately equally likely to catch prey. Hunting success as a singleton did not predict an individual's prey capture probability when in a group, suggesting that group hunting involves some producer-scrounger dynamics. In conclusion, while the experiment cannot address the question of how group size affects individual net calorie intake, the results show that groups are more successful at hunting than singletons are.

A field experiment in the wild Zebra Finch	ECOLOGY			English	Article						colony; crop seed count; density-dependent cost; food finding; foraging rate; nesting density; parental care; phenotype; producer-scrounger; provisioning; reproductive investment; Taeniopygia guttata	INFORMATION-CENTER HYPOTHESIS; CLIFF SWALLOWS; TAENIOPYGIA-GUTTATA; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; COLONY SIZE; BEHAVIOR; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; PASSERINE; COST	The foraging benefits of coloniality, whereby colony members exchange information about food location, have been suggested as a primary factor influencing the evolution of coloniality. However, despite its longstanding popularity, this hypothesis has rarely been tested experimentally. Here, we conducted a field experiment in the wild Zebra Finch Taeniopygia guttata to test whether colonial birds are better at finding food than solitary individuals. We manipulated food patch location and directly measured foraging activity of many colonial and solitary parents at those patches using an electronic monitoring system. We provided nesting sites in excess to alleviate nest site competition and manipulated brood size to eliminate the possible correlation between brood size, nesting density, and individual quality (including foraging activity). We found that solitary birds found experimental food patches first, closely followed by colonial birds. Moreover, solitary parents adjusted the amount of food per nestling to experimental brood size, whereas colonial parents did not, although overall, nestlings were fed more per capita in colonial than in solitary nests. In addition, brood size and, to a lesser extent, nesting density negatively affected nestling growth. Therefore, with the effect of provisioning rate, sibling competition, and cost of coloniality combined, nestling mass was not affected by the brood manipulation in solitary nests, whereas nestlings were lighter in enlarged than in reduced broods in colonies. Our results therefore suggest that individuals settling in solitary nests were intrinsically better foragers and more optimal parents. While they do not invalidate the possibility of information transfer at colonies, our findings highlight the importance of considering settlement bias in future studies and add to the existing evidence that the effects of nesting density on fitness are both complex and multiple.

In the present study, human participants engaged in an ecologically valid artifact-design task with the opportunity to engage in a range of social learning strategies: payoff bias, conformity, averaging and random copying. The artifact (an arrowhead) was composed of multiple continuous and discrete attributes which jointly generated a complex multimodal adaptive landscape that likely reflects actual cultural fitness environments. Participants exhibited a mix of individual learning and payoff-biased social learning, with negligible frequencies of the other social learning strategies. This preference for payoff-biased social learning was evident from the initial trials, suggesting that participants came into the study with an intrinsic preference for this strategy. There was also a small but significant increase in the frequency of payoff-biased social learning over sessions, suggesting that strategy choice may itself be subject to learning. Frequency of payoff-biased social learning predicted both absolute and relative success in the task, especially in a multimodal (rather than unimodal) fitness environment. This effect was driven by a minority of hardcore social learners who copied the best group member on more than half of trials. These hardcore social learners were also above-average individual learners, suggesting a link between individual and social learning ability. The lower-than-expected frequency of social learning may reflect the existence of information producer scrounger dynamics in human populations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We presented socially foraging house sparrows with a choice between scattered feeding wells in which millet seeds were hidden under 2 types of colored sand: green sand offering similar to 80 seeds with a probability of 0.1 (high risk-high reward) and yellow sand offering 1 seed with certainty (low risk-low reward). Although the expected benefit of choosing variable wells was 8 times higher than that of choosing constant wells, only some sparrows developed a preference for variable wells, whereas others developed a significant preference for constant wells. We found that this dichotomy could be explained by stochastic individual differences in sampling success during foraging, rather than by social foraging strategies (active searching vs. joining others). Moreover, preference for variable or constant wells was related to the sparrows' success during searching, rather than during joining others or when picking exposed seeds (i.e., they learn when actively searching in the sand). Finally, although for many sparrows learning resulted in an apparently maladaptive risk aversion, group living still allowed them to enjoy profitable variable wells by occasionally joining variable-preferring sparrows.

Although the use of social foraging tactics is partly flexible, yet some individuals tend to produce more, whereas others largely prefer to scrounge. This between-individual variation in tactic use closely resembles the phenomenon of animal personality; however, the connection between personality and social foraging tactic use has rarely been investigated in wild animals. Here, we studied this relationship in free-living Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) during 2 winters. We found that in females, but not in males, social foraging tactic use was predicted by personality: more exploratory (i.e., more active in a novel environment) females scrounged more. Regardless of sex, the probability of scrounging increased with the density of individuals foraging on feeders and the time of feeding within a foraging bout, that is, the later the individual foraged within a foraging bout the higher the probability of scrounging was. Our results demonstrate that consistent individual behavioral differences are linked, in a sex-dependent manner, to group-level processes in the context of social foraging in free-living tree sparrows, suggesting that individual behavioral traits have implications for social evolution.

J	Roberts, G				Roberts, Gilbert			When Punishment Pays	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STRONG RECIPROCITY; ALTRUISTIC PUNISHMENT; COSTLY PUNISHMENT; NEURAL BASIS; EVOLUTION; COOPERATION; BEHAVIOR; SELECTION; BENEFITS	Explaining cooperation in groups remains a key problem because reciprocity breaks down between more than two. Punishing individuals who contribute little provides a potential answer but changes the dilemma to why pay the costs of punishing which, like cooperation itself, provides a public good. Nevertheless, people are observed to punish others in behavioural economic games, posing a problem for existing theory which highlights the difficulty in explaining the spread and persistence of punishment. Here, I consider the apparent mismatch between theory and evidence and show by means of instructive analysis and simulation how much of the experimental evidence for punishment comes from scenarios in which punishers may expect to obtain a net benefit from punishing free-riders. In repeated games within groups, punishment works by imposing costs on defectors so that it pays them to switch to cooperating. Both punishers and non-punishers then benefit from the resulting increase in cooperation, hence investing in punishment can constitute a social dilemma. However, I show the conditions in which the benefits of increased cooperation are so great that they more than offset the costs of punishing, thereby removing the temptation to free-ride on others' investments and making punishment explicable in terms of direct self-interest. Crucially, this is because of the leveraging effect imposed in typical studies whereby people can pay a small cost to inflict a heavy loss on a punished individual. In contrast to previous models suggesting punishment is disadvantaged when rare, I show it can invade until it comes into a producer-scrounger equilibrium with non-punishers. I conclude that adding punishment to an iterated public goods game can solve the problem of achieving cooperation by removing the social dilemma.

Considering the nonlinearity and the multi-peak characteristics of PV array output curve under the condition of partial shadow, a multi-producer group search optimization (MGSO) method for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is proposed in this paper. In the MGSO, the characteristics and operations of three categories of members, including producers, scroungers, and rangers, are set according to the P-U characteristics. The number of producers is determined by the number of peaks. The initial position of each producer locates dispersedly to each peak region which makes the producers not fall into local optimum. The search strategy is simplified by the proposed angle transformation function of scroungers and omitting the ranger. The results of simulation and comparison demonstrate that the proposed MGSO method can effectively track the maximum power point under the uniform irradiance or partially shaded conditions, and also increase the utilization of solar energy.

BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Plasticity in tactic use; Mate preference; Sexual selection; Zebra finch	MATE CHOICE; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BEHAVIORAL PLASTICITY; MALE DISPLAYS; SELECTION; PERSONALITY; SONG; COURTSHIP; INDICATOR; QUALITY	There is ample evidence that phenotypic traits are important mate choice criteria. Yet, we still know little about the importance of behavioural plasticity in attracting mates, although females could gain direct and/or indirect fitness benefits by choosing males that can adjust their behaviour to environmental fluctuations. Plasticity in foraging tactic use, particularly, might be a key determinant of fitness that could guide mate choice. In this study, we thus asked whether female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) prefer males exhibiting greater plasticity in their foraging tactic use. We measured individual plasticity in a producer-scrounger game where males and females, playing in turn, were exposed to two seed distribution treatments, and females could monitor the males' behaviour, unbeknownst to them. Subsequently, we measured the time each female spent in front of the males they had previously observed in the expectation that females would exhibit a general preference for males with greater plasticity in tactic use. Contrary to our expectation, we found that females did not unanimously prefer the males exhibiting greater plasticity but differed widely in their preference with more plastic females showing a stronger preference for male plasticity compared to the other females. Thus, our findings suggest that differences among females in their mating preference would contribute to maintaining differences in plasticity in tactic use. Significance statement Mate choice is a crucial decision in an individual's life that directly impacts its fitness. Given that females could benefit from choosing males capable of responding to changes in environmental conditions, we asked in this study whether female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) prefer males exhibiting greater plasticity in their foraging tactic use. We let females observe males expressing plasticity in a social foraging context and scored their mate preference for male plasticity. We found that females differed in their preference for male plasticity in tactic use, with more plastic females exhibiting a stronger preference for male plasticity compared to the others. Our results indicate that behavioural plasticity may be used as a mate choice criterion and hence suggest that mate choice might contribute to maintaining differences in male behavioural plasticity.

The foraging behaviour of eusocial animals such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera, is generally considered to be largely regulated by the colony nutritional state. Previous work based on the information primacy hypothesis has however found that honeybee foragers explore (sample resources) and exploit (consume resources) in accordance with their individual nutritional state. We therefore hypothesized that individual and colony nutritional states differ in their influence on individuals of different behavioural phenotypes such as dancers and followers, who are akin to producers and scroungers, respectively. This leads to the prediction that these two behavioural groups will differ with respect to their exploration-exploitation trade-off and in terms of how they prioritize individual and colony nutritional states. We tested our predictions by creating a mismatch between individual and colony nutritional states. Our results show that dancers and followers do not differ in their levels of exploration and exploitation, but dancers are more responsive to colony nutritional state than are followers with regard to managing their exploration-exploitation trade-off. We discuss these results in the context of how these two behavioural phenotypes may differ in their sensitivity to the different nutritional pathways regulating worker behaviour in a eusocial colony and the evolution of sociality in general.

For instance, it is thought that socially dominant individuals prefer the predator-safe central position of groups forcing subordinates to the periphery. Uneven spread of benefits among group members can occur when some animals (the scroungers) parasitically exploit the food findings of other foragers (the producers). Here ave focus on how playing producer or scrounger affects an individual's spatial position within a group. We model the movement of foraging animals playing scrounger or producer using a spatially explicit simulation, and use a genetic algorithm to establish movement rules. We find that groups containing producers and scroungers are more compact compared to an equivalent group of producers only. Furthermore, the position occupied by strategies varies: scroungers are mainly found in central positions, with producers in the periphery, suggesting that the best position for strategies differs. Dominants, therefore, should prefer movement rules which lead to central positions because of the positional benefits provided to the scrounger strategy they use. Moreover, position within a group will introduce an asymmetry among otherwise phenotypically symmetric individuals.

Advantages of social foraging in crab spiders: Groups capture more and larger prey despite the absence of a web	ETHOLOGY			English	Article						group hunting; group living; prey size; producer; scrounger; social spiders	ANELOSIMUS-EXIMIUS ARANEAE; LOCAL ENHANCEMENT; EVOLUTION; COOPERATION; SUCCESS; COMPETITION; SOLITARY; BENEFITS; INSIGHTS; BEHAVIOR	Among group-living spiders, subsocial representatives in the family of crab spiders (Thomisidae) are a special case, as they build protective communal leaf nests instead of extensive communal capture webs. It could thus be inferred that antipredator benefits (e.g., enhanced protection in larger nests) rather than foraging-related advantages (e.g., capture of more and larger prey) promote sociality in this family. Nonetheless, subsocial crab spiders do share prey, and if this behaviour does not reflect mere food scramble but has a cooperative character, crab spiders may offer insights into the evolution of social foraging applicable to many other cooperative predators that hunt without traps. Here, we performed a comparative laboratory feeding experiment on three of the four subsocial crab spider speciesAustralomisidia ergandros, Australomisidia socialis and Xysticus bimaculatusto determine if crab spiders derive advantages from foraging in groups. In particular, we tested artificially composed groups of five sibling spiderlings vs. single siblings in terms of prey capture success and prey size preference. Across species, groups had higher prey capture success (measured in terms of capture rates and capture latency) and were more likely to attack large, sharable preydynamics leading to reduced food competition among group members in favour of living and foraging in groups. Within groups, we further compared prey extraction efficiency among the three applied social foraging tactics: producing, scrounging and feeding alone. In A.ergandros, individuals were exceptionally efficient when using the non-cooperative scrounger tactic, which entails feeding on the prey provided by others. Thus, our multispecies comparison confirms foraging advantages in maintaining a cooperative lifestyle for crab spiders, but also demonstrates the relevance of research into exploitation of cooperative foraging in this family.

J	Rita, H; Ranta, E				Rita, H; Ranta, E			Group foraging, gain and the finder's advantage	OIKOS			English	Article							CAPTIVE FLOCKS; INFORMATION; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; ENVIRONMENT	Individuals in a foraging group obeying information sharing make use of knowledge of food-patch locations found by others. A patch found by one will also be exploited by other members in the group. We are interested in the accumulation of gain of the individual finding the parch, the finder. Finding a patch of prey can lead to asymmetries in foraging success when finders get a larger share of the patch than others. Using renewal processes we have modelled this finder's advantage in gain accumulation and derived expectation and variance of gain. Not surprisingly, the longer the finder's privileged time in exploitation of the food patch, the more its gain resembles that of a solitary forager, while with short finder's time finder's gain is close to that of another non-finding group member. Consider, however, that patch-finding ability might be linked with individual characteristics, some bring better finders (producers) than others. If producers are foraging among less skilled finders (scroungers), both the within-patch and between-patch components of gain variance are larger for the producers than if they foraged in a group of individuals of equal patch-finding ability. So, if the foragers are risk-averse, the expectation is for patch-finding skill assorted foraging groups.

In this paper, an improved group search optimization (IGSO) method is proposed to solve the OFF problem with the valve-point loading effects, which is an optimization problem with many local optima. In the IGSO algorithm, the search space of the scroungers is enlarged to give a more sufficient exploitation around the producer and to help the scroungers explore other areas to avoid falling into a local optimum. A strategy is also introduced to help scroungers to learn from other members to improve the global searching ability. Moreover, scroungers and rangers update their positions only when better positions are found. Good performances of the IGSO algorithm on the OFF problem with the valve-point loading effects are verified by tests on a 26-bus system, and the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems.

In order to further improve its global and local search abilities, in this paper, an improved SSA (ISSA) is put forward where the main novelties lie in the producer centralization strategy, the vector encirclement model and the direction selection strategy. The producer centralization strategy is designed to update the position of producer with the hope of improving the global search ability of the producer, while the vector encirclement model and the direction selection strategy are proposed to update the position of scrounger for the purpose of improving the local search ability of scrounger. For the comparison purpose, the performances of the proposed ISSA and the existing excellent algorithms are tested in CEC2017 benchmark functions and 30 real-world constrained optimization problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ISSA substantially improves the convergence rate, optimization accuracy, stability of the SSA and can solve a wide range of real-world constrained optimization problems successfully with satisfactory performances. Finally, the proposed ISSA is successfully applied in the trajectory optimization of mechanical arms.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While producers rely on personal information and past experience, we may ask whether the tendency to forage as a producer is related to being a better learner. To answer this question, we hand-raised house sparrow (Passer domesticus) nestlings that upon independence were given an individual-learning task that required them to associate colour signal and food presence. Following the testing phase, all fledglings were released into a shared aviary, and their social-foraging tendencies were measured. We found a significant positive correlation between individual's performance in the individual-learning task and subsequent tendency to use searching (producing) behaviour. Individual-learning score was negatively correlated with initial fear of the test apparatus and with body weight. However, the correlation between individual learning and searching remained significant after controlling for these variables. Since it was measured before the birds entered a social group, individual-learning ability could not be the outcome of being a producer. However, the two traits may be initially associated, or individual learning could facilitate producing behaviour. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that associates individual-learning abilities with social-foraging strategies in animal groups.

To maintain the group diversity, SEGSO employs a self-adaptive role assignment strategy, which determines whether a member is a scrounger or a ranger based on ConK consecutive iterations of the producer. On the other hand, scroungers are updated with elitist strategy based on simulated annealing by using history information to improve convergence and guarantee SEGSO to remain global search. Experimental results demonstrate that SEGSO outperform particle swarm optimizer and original GSO in convergence rate and escaping from local optima.

The high degree of sociality typical of cooperative societies may indicate an important role of social foraging for learning and innovation. We studied 1) social foraging strategies and 2) the acquisition of a novel foraging skill in 16 groups of wild, cooperatively breeding Arabian babblers (Turdoides squamiceps). In Experiment 1, we provided a foraging grid of 96 feeding wells to each group, allowing them either to search for food individually (producer) or to join other birds (scrounger). Subordinates scrounged significantly more than dominant individuals, spent longer on the foraging grid, and had a higher proportion of their foraging steps rewarded (due to the effect of successful scrounging). However, scrounging was not related to poor learning ability because almost all the individuals that learned the novel foraging skill in Experiment 2 (removing a rubber lid to reach food) were scroungers. These findings suggest that group members differ in their foraging strategies and learning abilities according to their rank and that subordinate group members may be more opportunistic and flexible in their behavior than dominants, making use of both scrounging and novel foraging opportunities.

J	Vickery, WL				Vickery, William L.			Producing and scrounging can have stabilizing effects at multiple levels of organization	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						adaptive dynamics; biodiversity; competition; density dependence; food chain; predation; producing; scrounging; stability	POPULATION-DENSITY; BEHAVIOR; SIZE; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS	This study shows, for the first time, that the evolution of a simple behavior, scrounging, at the individual level can have effects on populations, food chains, and community structure. In particular, the addition of scrounging in consumer populations can allow multiple consumers to coexist while exploiting a single prey. Also, scrounging in the top predator of a tritrophic food chain can stabilize interactions between the top predator, its prey, and its prey's prey. This occurs because the payoffs to scrounging for food in a population are negative frequency dependent, allowing scroungers to invade a population and to coexist with producers at a frequency which is density-dependent. The presence of scroungers, who do not search for resources but simply use those found by others (producers) reduces the total amount of resource acquired by the group. As scrounging increases with group size, this leads to less resource acquired per individual as the group grows. Ultimately, this limits the size of the group, its impact on its prey, and its ability to outcompete other species. These effects can promote stability and thus increase species diversity. I will further suggest that prey may alter their spatial distribution such that scrounging will be profitable among their predators thus reducing predation rate on the prey.

Divergence in social foraging among morphs of the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						information sharing; resource defence; scrounger-producer; shoaling; social learning; speciation	KLEPTOPARASITIC PREY COMPETITION; THREESPINE STICKLEBACK; RESOURCE DEFENSE; SHOALING PREFERENCES; POECILIA-RETICULATA; FOOD EXPLOITATION; PREDATION RISK; INFORMATION; AGGRESSION; FISH	Foraging in social groups has a number of benefits but can also increase the risk of exploitation. High tendency to shoal may be correlated with groups foraging, although facultatively social fish adjust both shoaling decisions and food resource defence based on intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The main aim of this study was to examine the relationships between shoaling, solitary foraging and aggression, forager tolerance of conspecifics joining at a discovered food patch and forager exploitation of resources discovered by others. We used two intra-lacustrine three-spined stickleback morph pairs, lava and mud, and monomorphic morphs from each of lava and mud habitats. The lava morph formed less cohesive shoals, was bolder during solitary foraging, approached and entered an occupied food patch less frequently than the mud morph, suggesting a link between shoaling and the propensity for social foraging. However, shoaling tendency and joiner tolerance were not correlated at a population level. Intralacustrine lava and mud morphs differed more markedly in joiner tolerance than morphs from single habitat lakes, whereas the opposite was true for shoaling tendency. We conclude that, in addition to differentiation in shoaling tendency, the lava and mud morphs differ in social foraging and these variations may act to promote population divergence.

J	Monus, F; Barta, Z				Monus, Ferenc; Barta, Zoltan			The effect of within-flock spatial position on the use of social foraging tactics in free-living tree sparrows	ETHOLOGY			English	Article							ENERGY RESERVES; HOUSE SPARROWS; PRODUCER; DOMINANCE; RISK; SCROUNGERS; GEOMETRY; CHOICE; BIRDS; GAMES	The benefit of producer (searches for own food) or scrounger (exploits the others' food discoveries) foraging tactic in a group of socially feeding animals may depend on where the individual searches for food within the group. Scrounging may be more advantageous in the centre of the group, having more individuals around to join, while producing may be more beneficial at the edges, where more unexplored food patches may be found. This study shows within-flock position correlates with foraging tactic use of feeding birds in socially foraging tree sparrows, Passer montanus. Sparrows staying closer to the centre of the flock found their food patches more frequently by joining (i.e. use more frequently the scrounging tactic) than those staying toward the edges. To our knowledge this is the first field study demonstrating the relationship between spatial position and foraging tactic use. We investigated this relationship under different perceived predation hazard, and found that under elevated risk of predation, central individuals may increase their use of joining more than individuals on the periphery of the flock. Moreover, we show that extremely specialized use of searching tactics may be very infrequent in tree sparrows. As both within-flock position and search tactic use can be altered very quickly and without leaving the flock, individuals may easily alter them in order to adjust their behaviour.

The levy flight strategy is employed for the producer to simplify the computation and improve efficiency in the exploring space. The self-adaptive joining strategy is used for the scroungers walking towards the producer to promote convergence speed. The chaotic mutation strategy is designed for the rangers to strengthen diversification. Using those strategies, the modified algorithm can get better balance between intensification and diversification. The simulation experiments, which were carried on benchmark functions, show that those strategies are effective, and they improve the global optimization ability and convergence speed of modified group search optimizer for high dimensional function optimization.

J	Werdenich, D; Huber, L				Werdenich, D; Huber, L			Social factors determine cooperation in marmosets	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							COMMON MARMOSET; CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; INFANT-CARE; NONREPRODUCTIVE HELPERS; CAPUCHIN MONKEYS; WILD POPULATION; CEBUS-APELLA; TAMARINS; MACACA; ORGANIZATION	We investigated which factors determine cooperative behaviour of common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, in an instrumental task. During the approach phase each of eight individuals of a family group learned in isolation to pull a handle moving a bowl with attractive food towards its reach. In the following two experimental phases we used 16 dyads. In a dyadic training phase we assessed whether the partners were willing to manipulate the apparatus and to share food. In the subsequent cooperation test we examined whether they were willing to cooperate at a slightly modified apparatus whose solution required one individual (the producer) to pull the handle and the other (the scrounger) to grasp the bowl. Although all individuals were willing to cooperate with at least one partner, only half of the dyads solved the task in the cooperation phase. Examination of the factors that correlated with success in this phase revealed that primarily those dyads cooperated in which the dominant subject took the role of the scrounger and the subordinate took the role of the producer. However, in ' these successful dyads the dominant animal did not force the subordinate partner to pull the handle. Rather, the partners of cooperative dyads shared the reward and pulled equally often in both the dyadic training and the cooperation test. Thus, cooperation of marmosets in an instrumental task seems to depend on a specific distribution of roles and the tolerance of higher-ranking individuals., (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

It has fast convergence speed, strong optimization ability and more extensive application scenarios compared with traditional heuristic search methods. And thus, the SSA is attracting the attention of researchers in different fields. However, there are deficiencies of initial population quality, search ability, and population diversity in the SSA. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA). The ISSA uses skew tent map-based chaotic method to produce initial population for a higher quality of convergence. For the location update of the producer sparrows during the iterations, the ISSA introduces a non-linear decreasing weight, promoting both exploration and exploitation of the search space, to improve the convergence and search precision. And the mutation strategy is employed to update the location of the scrounger sparrows with lower energy and the chaotic search is combined with the local exploitation for the scroungers with higher energy, which can enhance the diversity and avoid trapping in local optimum. Simulation experiments are carried out on 26 benchmark test functions. And the results show that the ISSA is superior to or at least competitive to the SSA in the convergence properties of accuracy, speed, and stability.

J	Beauchamp, G				Beauchamp, G			The effect of prior residence and pair bond on scrounging choices in flocks of zebra finches, Taenopygia guttata	BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES			English	Article						flocking; pair bond; prior residence; scrounging; zebra finches	DARK-EYED JUNCOS; FORAGING SUCCESS; INFORMATION-CENTERS; SOCIAL-DOMINANCE; FOOD; BEHAVIOR; HYEMALIS; PIGEONS; COMPETITION; HIERARCHY	In groups, animals can use the producer tactic to locate food patches and the scrounger tactic to join the food discoveries of other companions. At equilibrium, models predict a mixture of the two tactics with equal payoffs. Several factors may constraints the use of tactics and lead to biases in scrounging choices. I explored the effect of prior residence and pair bond as potential constraints on scrounging choices in flocks of zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata). Experimental flocks contained two birds already established in an aviary (prior residents) and two birds recently released in the aviary for the first time (new residents). All birds were previously trained to find food on a foraging grid. In the aviary, new residents followed prior residents from perches to the grid and relied heavily on prior residents to locate food patches. Low initial success by new residents probably favoured heavy reliance on the scrounger tactic. New residents that Formed pair bonds with prior residents foraged closer to their mates and scrounged selectively from their mates in some cases. Prior residence, and pair bond to a lesser extent, influenced scrounging choices in zebra finches and could lead to deviation from the expected use of foraging tactics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Held, S; Mendl, M; Devereux, C; Byrne, RW				Held, S; Mendl, M; Devereux, C; Byrne, RW			Foraging pigs alter their behaviour in response to exploitation	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							TACTICAL DECEPTION; SPICE FINCHES; FLOCKS; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; HIERARCHY; GEOMETRY; PRIMATES	When food finders are exploited by others, but cannot themselves switch to scrounging or leave their foraging group, other behavioural adaptations should be favoured. Tactical deception in primates and foraging at the periphery of the group in ground-feeding birds have been suggested as two such responses. We show that exploited individuals may also respond by adjusting their foraging behaviour to the concurrent behaviour of the scroungers. We investigated the foraging strategies of exploited subordinate domestic pigs, Sus scrofa. Pairs of pigs were tested in competitive foraging trials. We trained the subordinate pig in each pair to use a producing tactic in competitive pair trials by informing it about the location of hidden food during a preceding search trial in which it foraged alone. The dominant pig was naive about the food location in the competitive trials but able to displace the subordinate from the food source. We have shown previously that the dominants scrounged on their coforagers in these competitive trials by following them and displacing them from the food source. In the present study, logistic regression analyses show that the food-finding subordinates altered their foraging behaviour depending on the current behaviour of the dominants. Overall, the subordinates were more likely to show food-directed behaviour when the chances of arriving at the food source ahead of their exploiters were higher. The foraging behaviour of individual subordinates was related to their exploitation experience. Individuals subjected to higher exploitation pressure showed more varied strategies. These behavioural strategies are most simply interpreted as attempts by the exploited food finders to increase the time they can spend at the food source before the scroungers arrive.

The scheduling process in cloud computing platform needs a good algorithm to schedule the jobs of different users. The main objective of this approach is to develop a scheduling algorithm through iterative algorithm. Here, we use oppositional group search optimization algorithm for iterative process in cloud computing. Initially, we generate a population that contains a group of members and the members consist of the number of users and their respective jobs. The motto of our research is to schedule the user given jobs efficiently. We separate the members from the population based on the fitness function to perform different operations and to generate new members. We calculate the fitness for the new members and iterate the process until we get a stable best member for repeated iteration. Then, we schedule the jobs for the users based on the best member obtained.

This ISI may either indicate the location of food (social information, SI), or it may indicate the quality of the resource (Public information, PI). To date, few studies have explored the selective consequences for prey of being exploited by predators that use ISI. Prey exploited by such predators should evolve traits that favour high levels of ISI use (scrounging) because this would result in lower predator search efficiency given that fewer predators would be searching directly for the prey. Our Simulations confirm that ISI-using predators should increase their use of ISI when their prey form larger clumps resulting in higher prey survival. Our objective therefore is to explore whether prey will evolve towards higher clumpiness when their predators use ISI, using genetic algorithm Simulation. The prey were subjected to one of three types of predators for over 500 prey generations. The predators either used: (1) no social information (NS), (2) SI only, or (3) PI. Surprisingly, the prey evolved the highest clumpiness for NS predators. Prey evolved towards smaller clump sizes with SI predators and the clumps were marginally larger when predators used PI. The result is due to the prey evolving the minimum clumpiness required to cause maximal ISI use by their predators. We discuss how this response by prey may favour the use of PI over SI in their ISI-using predators.

On the one hand, recent theoretical models predict increased use of scrounging with increasing predation risk, when scroungers seeking feeding opportunities also have a higher chance of detecting predators. On the other hand, there may be no relation between tactic use and predation when antipredator vigilance is not compatible with scanning flockmates. We investigated experimentally the effects of predation risk on social foraging tactic use in tree sparrows, Passer montanus. We manipulated predation risk in the field by changing the distance between shelter and a feeder. Birds visited the feeder in smaller flocks, spent less time on it and were somewhat more vigilant far from shelter than close to it. Increased predation risk strongly affected the social foraging tactic used: birds used the scrounger tactic 30% more often far from cover than close to it. Between-flock variability in scrounging frequency was not related to the average vigilance level of the flock members, and within-flock variability in the use of scrounging was negatively related to the vigilance of birds. Our results suggest that in tree sparrows, the increased frequency of scrounging during high predation risk cannot simply be explained by an additional advantage of increasing antipredator vigilance. We propose alternative mechanisms (e.g. increased stochasticity in food supply, and that riskier places are used by individuals with lower reserves) that may explain increased scrounging when animals forage under high predation risk.

However, in the real manufacturing environments, the machines could be unavailable inevitably for many reasons. In this paper, the authors introduce the hybrid flowshop scheduling problem with random breakdown (RBHFS) together with a discrete group search optimizer algorithm (DGSO). In particular, two different working cases, preempt-resume case, and preempt-repeat case are considered under random breakdown. The proposed DGSO algorithm adopts the vector representation and several discrete operators, such as insert, swap, differential evolution, destruction, and construction in the producers, scroungers, and rangers phases. In addition, an orthogonal test is applied to configure the adjustable parameters in the DGSO algorithm. The computational results in both cases indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the performances compared with other high performing algorithms in the literature.

GSO is inspired by animal searching behavior and group living theory. The framework of GSO is mainly based on the cooperation of producer, scroungers and rangers, which play different roles during the search. GSO has been successfully applied to solve a wider range of benchmark functions [1]. This paper investigates the application of GSO to resolve the power system economic dispatch problem with consideration of minimizing the objectives of fuel cost and transmission line loss. The performance of GSO has been compared with that of genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarming optimizer (PSO), and the simulation results have demonstrated that GSO outperforms the other two algorithms. The application is also extended to determine the optimal locations and control parameters of flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices to achieve the objective. Simulation studies have been carried out on a standard test system and better results have been obtained by GSO.

J	Beauchamp, G				Beauchamp, G			Should vigilance always decrease with group size?	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						anti-predator vigilance; scrounging; group size; food distribution	ANTIPREDATORY VIGILANCE; PUBLIC INFORMATION; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; MAMMALS; SURVEILLANCE; FLOCKING; DISTANCE; BEHAVIOR; BASICS	Levels of anti-predator vigilance often decrease with group size in birds and mammals. Vigilance may also serve other purposes such as scrounging. While scrounging, individual adopt the vigilant posture to locate and eventually exploit the food discoveries of their companions. Models that combine anti-predator alertness and scrounging were developed to examine how changes in scrounger use with group size could alter the shape of the function relating vigilance to group size and whether the additional investment in vigilance while searching could be used to reduce the allocation of time to vigilance while in the food patch. Results indicate that increased allocation of time to scrounging during search can add to the overall level of vigilance and even counteract the expected decrease in vigilance with group size. However, the addition of scrounging was found to have little impact on vigilance while in the food patch. Behavioral effects that are dependent on group size, such as scrounging, may lead to changes in the shape of the vigilance function and may mitigate against any gain garnered from a reduction in individual levels of vigilance in larger groups.

The chaotic system constructed by it can improve its unpredictability and complexity. Parameter identification of a memristive chaotic system is the primary task to implement chaos control and synchronization. To identify the unknown parameters accurately and quickly, we introduce the Sine Pareto Sparrow Search Algorithm (SPSSA), a modified sparrow search algorithm (SSA). in this research. Firstly, we introduce the Pareto distribution to alter the scroungers' location in the SSA. Secondly, we use a sine-cosine strategy to improve the producers' position update. These measures can effectively accelerate the convergence speed and avoid local optimization. Thirdly, the SPSSA is used to identify the parameters of a memristive chaotic system. The proposed SPSSA exceeds the classic SSA, particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), and artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) in simulations based on the five benchmark functions. The simulation results of parameter identification of a memristive chaotic system show that the method is feasible, and the algorithm has a fast convergence speed and high estimation accuracy.

In this paper, we study a flow shop sequencing problem (FSSP) with controllable processing times as a special case of reconfigurable manufacturing system. It is possible to speed up the processing times through assigning additional resources or control of machine speed. After formulating this problem mathematically, a novel evolutionary procedure, entitled group search optimizer (GSO), is devised as solution method. The adapted GSO is a population-based search tool which is devised based on the producer and scrounger behavior. GSO emphasizes on imitating searching model of real-world animals. The basic GSO with four promising improvements is elaborated and discussed for addressing the FSSP with controllable processing times. A set of computational experiments is also conducted to demonstrate the applicability of proposed FSSP and performance of improved GSOs.

Flocks of naive pigeons were first exposed to an experienced pigeon trained to open food caches identified by different colored seals, where colors identified different amounts of grain. Later, the experienced pigeon was removed from the experimental setting, and the naive pigeons were tested with the correlation between colors and amounts of food maintained. The results showed that the naive pigeons acquired the food-obtaining response, and that they performed it discriminately by responding in a greater proportion to the stimulus associated with a larger food cache. With respect to foraging strategies, the pigeons adopted the roles of producer and scrounger; varying as a function of group composition. These findings are consistent with previous studies on social learning and with the theory of optimal foraging.

ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						feeding time; food availability; foraging; goats; group living	PUBLIC INFORMATION; GOATS; DOMINANCE; VIGILANCE; PRODUCERS; HIERARCHY; DYNAMICS; QUALITY; MODEL; SIZE	Group-living animals use social information when making patch-joining/scrounging decisions. However, the extent to which they use finder's share (i.e. amount of food eaten in a patch before other individuals arrive) as a cue when making these decisions is unknown. It is likely that the removal of finder's share decreases patch attractiveness to scroungers. However, it is unclear how large a finder's share must be to reduce attractiveness, or how this varies with food availability. To answer these questions, we recorded the patch-joining decisions of dominant goats, Capra hircus, when presented with a choice between an artificial patch where finder's share had been removed by a subordinate patch holder (producer), and one where the patch holder had just started eating. We used time spent feeding by a patch holder (10, 30, 60 and 120 s) as an index of finder's share size, and tested this using three food availabilities (40 g, 100 g and 300 g). At low (40 g) and intermediate (100 g) food availabilities, scrounging goats avoided the finder's share patch once the patch holder had fed for >= 30 s (i.e. 25% and 17% of the food removed, respectively). However, at the highest food availability (300 g), these goats continued to join the finder's share patch even after the patch holder had fed for 120 s (18% removed). Ultimately, our results indicate that goats weigh up both food availability and the finder's share when making scrounging decisions. Nevertheless, finder's share removal was less important in patches with more food. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Diet overlap was greater between C julis and M. surmuletus in comparison to other combinations. Ail three species were diurnal feeders, but with different daily patterns of foraging based on different prey availability. There was a general spatio-temporal correlation in non-foraging activity among the three species, but foraging activity was correlated only between C. julis and the other two species, but not between S, cinereus and M, surmuletus. There was heterospecific aggregation during foraging between C. julis and M, surmuletus, and possibly a scrounger-producer relationship between them. Fights between C. julis specimens related to foraging activity were common, but not between species. These results support the view that differences in spatio-temporal organization of activity, and interactions during foraging, can contribute to resource partitioning among syntopic populations of fish belonging to the same trophic group.

By adopting favorable features of the group search technique, a hybrid discrete group search optimizer is proposed for finding high quality schedules in the no-wait job shops with the total flow time criterion. In order to find more promising sequences, the producer operator is designed as a destruction and construction (DC) procedure and an insertion-based local search, the scrounger operator is implemented by differential evolution scheme, and the ranger operator is designed by hybridizing best insert moves. An efficient initialization scheme based on Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic is designed to construct the initial population with both quality and diversity. A speed-up method is developed to accelerate the evaluation of the insertion neighborhood. Computational results based on well-known benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm clearly outperforms a hybrid differential evolution algorithm and an iterated greedy algorithm. In addition, the proposed algorithm is comparable to a local search method based on optimal job insertion, especially for large-size instances. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A recent series of models predicts that competition in a heterogeneous environment might promote between-individual variation in behavioural plasticity. We tested groups of sticklebacks in patchy foraging environments that differed in the level of competition. We also tested the same individuals across two different social groups and while alone to determine the social environment's influence on behavioural plasticity. In support of model predictions, individuals consistently differed in behavioural plasticity when the presence of conspecifics influenced the potential payoffs of a foraging opportunity. Whether individuals maintained their level of behavioural plasticity when placed in a new social group depended on the environmental heterogeneity. By explicitly testing predictions of recent theoretical models, we provide evidence for the types of ecological conditions under which we would expect, and not expect, variation in behavioural plasticity to be favoured.

To address this issue, we propose a novel greedy genetic sparrow search algorithm based on a sine and cosine search strategy (GGSC-SSA). First, the greedy algorithm is introduced to initialize the population and to increase the diversity of the population. Second, genetic operators are used to update the population, balancing global search and local development capabilities. Finally, the adaptive weight is introduced in the producer update to increase the adaptability of the algorithm and to optimize the quality of the solution, and a sin-cosine search strategy is introduced to update the scroungers. In addition, the GGSC-SSA is compared with the genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), ant colony optimization (ACO) and the artificial fish (AF) algorithm on TSP datasets for performance testing. We also compare it with some recently improved algorithms. The results of the simulations are encouraging; the GGSC-SSA significantly enhances the solution precision, optimization speed and robustness.

BP neural network (BPNN) tends to converge to different local minimum points, and the prediction accuracy is not high in the prediction of the compressive strength of concrete. Therefore, a prediction model based on the BPNN optimized by improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) and random forest (RF) is proposed to enhance the generalization ability and prediction accuracy of BPNN for compressive strength of concrete. In terms of algorithm improvement, three improvements are proposed for SSA: Latin hypercube sampling is introduced to initialize the location of sparrows and increase the diversity of sparrows; the somersault foraging strategy is used to enrich the optimal position of producers; and combining with the cyclone foraging mechanism, the position updating process of the scroungers is optimized to obtain a better foraging position. In terms of performance evaluation of the algorithm, the ablation experiment verifies that the three improved strategies have improved effects in SSA, and the performance of ISSA on the CEC2017 benchmark function is better than other peers. In terms of predictive index screening, the important features are selected as the input variables of the model by random forest. The prediction results show that compared with the RF-BPNN model and models optimized by other algorithms, RF-ISSA-BPNN model has the lowest prediction error, and the expected value fits the real value better.

J	Mullon, C; Lehmann, L				Mullon, Charles; Lehmann, Laurent			Evolution of warfare by resource raiding favours polymorphism in belligerence and bravery	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						warfare; polymorphism; trait associations; kin selection	MODEL; COMPETITION; CONFLICT; BEHAVIOR; TRAITS; WAR	From protists to primates, intergroup aggression and warfare over resources have been observed in several taxa whose populations typically consist of groups connected by limited genetic mixing. Here, we model the coevolution between four traits relevant to this setting: (i) investment into common-pool resource production within groups (helping); (ii) proclivity to raid other groups to appropriate their resources (belligerence); and investments into (iii) defense and (iv) offense of group contests (defensive and offensive bravery). We show that when traits coevolve, the population often experiences disruptive selection favouring two morphs: 'Hawks', who express high levels of both belligerence and offensive bravery; and 'Doves', who express neither. This social polymorphism involves further among-traits associations when the fitness costs of helping and bravery interact. In particular, if helping is antagonistic with both forms of bravery, coevolution leads to the coexistence of individuals that either: (i) do not participate into common-pool resource production but only in its defense and appropriation (Scrounger Hawks) or (ii) only invest into common pool resource production (Producer Doves). Provided groups are not randomly mixed, these findings are robust to several modelling assumptions. This suggests that inter-group aggression is a potent mechanism in favouring within-group social diversity and behavioural syndromes.This article is part of the theme issue 'Intergroup conflict across taxa'.

This may be especially important for energy-constrained foragers, such as the frugivorous Peter's tent-making bat, Uroderma bilobatum. We used the outcome of a two-demonstrator social-learning test in which individual U. bilobatum had to make cue-elicited decisions based on food odours from bats from different social groups to test three alternative hypotheses. Bats could show either (1) a preference for information from roostmates ('familiar social partner'), (2) no bias in information used ('any social partner') or (3) a preference for novel cues from nonroostmates ('novel social partner' hypothesis). We found that U. bilobatum preferred food demonstrated by nonroostmates to that demonstrated by roostmates, providing support for the novel social partner hypothesis. Uroderma bilobatum bias their attention towards novel conspecifics, perhaps as a strategy for acquiring knowledge of unknown ephemeral food sources, which in turn might help them survive resource bottlenecks.

With two groups of individually marked, hand-reared greylag goslings we investigated hormonal and behavioural correlates related to the individual's ability to perform operant tasks. During individual tests 6 weeks after hatching, goslings were given small food containers covered by lids. In the following winter the sibling groups were tested in a social set-up at a food dispenser, which the geese could activate by pulling a flap. We analysed individual faecal samples collected at 2, 6 and 12 weeks of age, and also after the individual tests, for excreted corticosterone and testosterone metabolites by enzyme immunoassay. During the individual test, 18 of 23 individuals learned to remove the lids. These 18 birds excreted higher faecal corticosterone concentrations than their respective controls 2 weeks after hatching. At the food dispensers, only four males became food producers; all the others scrounged. These four were in the group of 18 that were successful in the individual test and again tended, although not significantly, to have higher faecal corticosterone 2 weeks after hatching than the scroungers. In one of the groups, excreted corticosterone increased and excreted testosterone decreased after the individual test. Goslings successfully removing lids at 6 weeks raised their faecal corticosterone to a significantly greater extent than the unsuccessful individuals. Our results suggest that becoming an innovator may be contingent upon individual coping styles. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The local top-predator community comprised c. 34 species of seabirds, two pinnipeds and eight cetaceans. It appeared that multi-species feeding associations (MSFA's),with rather low species richness and diversity, were commonly formed around fishing vessels, were attracted by or otherwise associated with cetaceans (MSFA's with a generally low but more variable species richness and moderate diversity) and occurred over natural resources, apparently mainly fish shoals (MSFA's with the highest species richness and diversity). Small, short-lived MSFA's were the commoner type, particularly those over natural prey (sandeels and small clupeoids). Black-legged Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla acted as catalysts in these flocks, Common Guillemots Uria aalge and Razorbills Alca torda as diving producers, apparently driving up fish towards the surface. The specific role of all other species joining in is described in general terms. Typical associations with marine mammals were those in which the cetaceans (mainly White-beaked Dolphins Lagenorhynchus albirostris and Harbour Porpoises Phocoena phocoena) operated as 'beaters' for Northern Gannets Morus bassanus and Black-legged Kittiwakes. The functioning of MSFA's is decribed from two angles. First of all, MSFA's are prominent phenomena on the sea surface, guiding seabirds using visual cues for food finding. Secondly, perhaps more importantly, the differentiation of feeding methods deployed in MSFA's may facilitate seabirds to reach prey that would otherwise be unavailable for them. It is suggested that the frequent associations of Kittiwakes and auks are the most sustainable system, because commensalism is the underlying mechanism rather than competition. The participation of scroungers in these flocks (Herring Gulls Larus argentatus as common nearshore examples) normally ruined the MSFA formation in no time. Usually, a MSFA would usually collapse as soon as the auks gave up their synchronised feeding activities. This underlines the essential role of Alcidae in these formations. The MSFA's are common and prominent in the North Sea and they deserve further study in the context of when interspecific relationships and the structuring of seabird communities.

J	Bugnyar, T; Kotrschal, K				Bugnyar, T; Kotrschal, K			Scrounging tactics in free-ranging ravens, Corvus corax	ETHOLOGY			English	Article							COMMON RAVENS; BEHAVIOR; PRODUCER; PREDATION; FLOCKING; GAME; KLEPTOPARASITISM; ENVIRONMENT; HIERARCHY; STARLINGS	Social foraging allows individuals to scrounge, i.e. to exploit the food others have made available. The conditions promoting scrounging as an alternative foraging tactic have yet received limited attention. We presently examine whether ravens, as opportunistic scavengers, adjust their foraging tactics according to the potential costs involved in accessing a particular food source. We observed wild ravens foraging in a game park, at the enclosures of wolves, Canis lupus, and wild boars, Sus scrofa. Wolves may aggressively defend their food and even kill ravens, whereas wild boars do not. When co-feeding with wolves, the ravens showed higher scrounging rates than with wild boars. Only at the wolves, they tended to specialize either on scrounging or on getting food directly from the site. However, scrounging techniques differed in relation to the state of food depletion. Early on, after food became available, the ravens most frequently displaced others from food, whereas towards the end, stealing, solicited sharing, and cache raiding became prevalent. These techniques differed in their profitability and their use was related to the scroungers age, social status and affiliative relationships. This suggests that ecological conditions, such as co-feeding with potential predators, may influence the individuals decision whether or not to scrounge in competition for food. Social conditions, on the other hand, may affect the way how to get at food possessed by others and may thus, to a large extent, determine the profitability of scrounging.

J	Amat, JA				Amat, JA			Courtship feeding, food sharing, or tolerated food theft among paired Red-crested Pochards (Netta rufina)?	JOURNAL FUR ORNITHOLOGIE			English	Article						feeding interactions; food sharing; kleptoparasitism; tolerated food theft	KLEPTOPARASITISM; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; DOMINANCE; COOTS	Red-crested Pochards (Netta rufina) have been observed feeding on plants brought by their mates to the water surface, and this behaviour has been traditionally considered as courtship feeding. In this paper I report on this behaviour and examine its behavioural context. Females fed more frequently than males on plants brought by their mates to the surface, and this behaviour always occurred among paired birds. Individuals that procured the food plants were never observed offering them to their mates, but the latter simply approached the former as they surfaced with plants. The main advantages of this feeding behaviour would be to increase intake rates, as well as to reduce the feeding costs, as no time is spent searching for food underwater Intake rates of individuals that procured the food were negatively affected when their mates profited from such food. Probably because of this, individuals that procured the food plants surfaced immediately after the feeding interaction with smaller quantities of food than before. This may be a strategy to discourage some individuals from feeding on plants brought to the surface by their mates, because this would allow the individuals that procure the food to ingest it before others start feeding on the plants. In this light, this feeding behaviour should not be considered as courtship feeding. Depending on whether pair bonds are maintained or split before breeding, this behaviour should be considered either as food sharing or tolerated food theft.

In addition, interference among individuals was introduced to reduce the efficiency of foraging groups. Foraging groups had a more homogeneous phenotypic composition than did randomly formed groups. Phenotypic heterogeneity as well as group size increased with food availability. The expected fitness of different phenotypes tended to increase with competitive ability, the largest fitness differences being between the best phenotype and all others. These differences, however, diminished as interference among individuals increased. In predictable environments fitness differences between phenotypes were at their greatest. Interestingly, in unpredictable environments poor competitors reached higher fitness levels than in predictable environments. Poorly performing individuals moved more between groups than did good competitors. Both increase in interference among individuals and decrease in food availability enhanced the frequency of movements.

Frequency-dependent conspecific attraction to food patches	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						conspecific attraction; genetic algorithm; population size; spatial resource heterogeneity	FLOCKS; INFORMATION; MECHANISMS; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; WINTER; MODEL	In many ecological situations, resources are difficult to find but become more apparent to nearby searchers after one of their numbers discovers and begins to exploit them. If the discoverer cannot monopolize the resources, then others may benefit from joining the discoverer and sharing their discovery. Existing theories for this type of conspecific attraction have often used very simple rules for how the decision to join a discovered resource patch should be influenced by the number of individuals already exploiting that patch. We use a mechanistic, spatially explicit model to demonstrate that individuals should not necessarily simply join patches more often as the number of individuals exploiting the patch increases, because those patches are likely to be exhausted soon or joining them will intensify future local competition. Furthermore, we show that this decision should be sensitive to the nature of the resource patches, with individuals being more responsive to discoveries in general and more tolerant of larger numbers of existing exploiters on a patch when patches are resource-rich and challenging to locate alone. As such, we argue that this greater focus on underlying joining mechanisms suggests that conspecific attraction is a more sophisticated and flexible tactic than currently appreciated.

We investigated the extent to which this innovation has spread in the local population, and what factors limit the acquisition of bin opening. Only five males of 36 individually recognised birds were observed to have performed successful bin opening. With one exception there were always other keas present, watching successful bin opening. Seventeen additional individuals were seen to have benefitted from lid opening. Their foraging success was less than that of the bin openers. Social status of bin openers did not differ from scrounging males. Among the individuals that were regularly seen at the site of the bins but were not successful in bin opening, social status and the ratio of feeding directly from open bins correlated with the amount of opening attempts. We conclude that scrounging facilitated certain behavioural aspects of bin opening rather than inhibiting them. The fact that only 9% of opening attempts were successful, and the long period of time required to increase efficiency in lid opening shows that mainly individual experience, and to a lesser extent insight and social learning, play key roles in acquisition of the opening technique. The results indicate that the spread of innovative solutions of challenging mechanical problems in animals may be restricted to only a few individuals.

The domain of danger concept was developed by ethologists to measure the predation risk taken by an individual within a group. In this work we make the analogy between information gathering for an autonomous agent team and food gathering for a group of animals to explore bio-inspired strategies for autonomous agent teams in an information gathering scenario. The sum of areas of domains of danger of the team is used as the measurement of risk taken by the whole team. Several movement rules that let an agent gather food nodes and/or shrink its domain of danger according to the current layout of the team and food nodes are proposed. The performance on foraging efficiency and team domain of danger of these movement rules are investigated by simulation. The results show that trying to shrink the domain of danger of each individual while no food can be gained in the near future doesn't degrade the foraging performance of the team and can effectively lower the risk taken by the whole team by prevention of over-spreading.

The main factors influencing the attack behaviour are the ability of the insect to escape, the risks of injury to the spiders and prey size. This study evaluated the effects of size and prey type on prey capture behaviour of the social spider Anelosimus eximius as influenced by the number of spiders attracted by prey movements that did not bite until the immobilization (bystanders) and the number of spiders that contributed to prey immobilization (catchers). We carried out a two-factor (prey size and type) experiment offering prey belonging to four orders: Diptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Orthoptera, in a size gradient within each prey type. Both factors influenced the number of spiders recruited as bystanders, but only prey body size influenced the number of catchers in the subduing process. The possible advantages of the presence of bystanders around the interception site are discussed.

Most accounts of resource sharing invoke special evolutionary processes or ecological circumstances that reduce their generality. Surprisingly, the Hawk-Dove game has been unable to address in a simple and general way why so many group foraging animals share food. We modify the Hawk-Dove game by allowing a finder the opportunity of retaliating if joiners escalate and by considering the consequences of information asymmetries concerning resource value among players. Introducing the first change, the retaliator strategy was sufficient to predict widespread sharing in habitats where food clumps are of intermediate richness. When information asymmetry between finder and joiner is created by allowing the quality of clumps to vary, we show that the conditions for sharing are even more easily met and apply to a wider range of resource qualities. Our model therefore offers one of the most parsimonious and potentially general evolutionary accounts of the origin of non-aggressive resource sharing.

One factor that can influence the finder's advantage is the patches' setup. We analyzed the strategies of Wistar rats foraging in groups n = 4 in a 4 x 3 array of deposits where only four of them were baited (patches) with different configurations on each trial. Specifically, the goal was to assess whether the finder's advantage varied according to the distribution (Square vs. Zig-zag) and distance (Small vs. Large) between patches. Foraging responses were classified as production (seeking for food) or scrounging (tracking conspecifics) to calculate the frequency of use of each strategy in each group and estimate the induced finder's advantage in each situation. In patch-setups with short distances, production was more common and the finder's advantage higher. Results can be explained by the combined effect of a local enhancing and simultaneous patch exploitation on small setups.

We extended the study of animal social tactics to the domestic pig, Sus scrofa, by using an experimental analogue of natural foraging skills, the 'informed forager' paradigm. We investigated the behaviour of 16 pigs foraging in pairs in an arena in which food had been hidden in one of eight monopolizable buckets. Before each pair trial, one of the pigs, the 'informed' pig, was given privileged knowledge about the location of the food during a solitary search trial. The 'noninformed' pig was naive about the location of the food during pair trials, but heavier than its informed partner and thus able to displace the latter from the baited bucket. By first focusing on the informed pigs' behaviour, we show that pigs are able to remember and relocate the food site. They found the food in relocation trials, using fewer bucket investigations than expected of a random searcher. Second, by focusing on the noninformed pigs, we show that pigs are able to exploit the knowledge of others by following them to a food source. They investigated more buckets immediately after their informed partners significantly more often than expected by chance and required fewer bucket investigations to find the food in pair trials than expected from a random searcher, but not in solitary search trials. We discuss these latter findings with reference to social foraging tactics. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Learning through observation has been investigated in several species, but learning from advice-where information is intentionally broadcast-is less understood. We used a pre-registered, online experiment (n = 1492) combined with computational modelling to examine learning through observation and advice. Participants were more likely to immediately follow advice than to copy an observed choice, but this was dependent upon trust in the adviser: highly paranoid participants were less likely to follow advice in the short term. Reinforcement learning modelling revealed two distinct patterns regarding the long-term effects of social information: some individuals relied fully on social information, whereas others reverted to trial-and-error learning. This variation may affect the prevalence and fidelity of socially transmitted information. Our results highlight the privileged status of advice relative to observation and how the assimilation of intentionally broadcast information is affected by trust in others.

Rapid evolution of social learning	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						gene-culture co-evolution; rapid evolution; Rogers' paradox; social learning	INCREASE HUMAN ADAPTABILITY; CULTURE; DYNAMICS; TIMESCALES; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; ANIMALS	Culture is widely thought to be beneficial when social learning is less costly than individual learning and thus may explain the enormous ecological success of humans. Rogers (1988. Does biology constrain culture. Am. Anthropol. 90: 819-831) contradicted this common view by showing that the evolution of social learning does not necessarily increase the net benefits of learned behaviours in a variable environment. Using simulation experiments, we re-analysed extensions of Rogers' model after relaxing the assumption that genetic evolution is much slower than cultural evolution. Our results show that this assumption is crucial for Rogers' finding. For many parameter settings, genetic and cultural evolution occur on the same time scale, and feedback effects between genetic and cultural dynamics increase the net benefits. Thus, by avoiding the costs of individual learning, social learning can increase ecological success. Furthermore, we found that rapid evolution can limit the evolution of complex social learning strategies, which have been proposed to be widespread in animals.

When intergroup encounters were simulated by playback of aggressive vocalizations, some individuals consistently led the approach to the recorded intruder, whereas others lagged behind and avoided the risks of fighting, The lead females recognized that certain companions were laggards but failed to punish them, which suggests that cooperation is not maintained by reciprocity. Modification of the ''odds'' in these encounters revealed that some females joined the group response when they were most needed, whereas other lagged even farther behind. The complexity of these responses emphasizes the great diversity of individual behavior in this species and the inadequacy of current theory to explain cooperation in large groups.

However, food sharing can be a more general phenomenon accounted for by more parsimonious, mutualistic explanations. We propose a game theoretical model of a general sharing situation in which food owners share because it is in their own self-interest-they avoid high costs associated with beggar harassment. When beggars harass, owners may benefit from sharing part of the food if their consumption rate is low relative to the rate of cost accrual. Our model predicts that harassment can be a profitable strategy for beggars if they reap some direct benefits from harassing other than shared food (such as picking up scraps). Therefore, beggars may manipulate the owner's fitness payoffs in such a way as to make sharing mutualistic.

Social learning from kin and non-kin in juvenile ringdoves	BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES			English	Article						social learning; kin; ringdoves; cultural transmission	FOOD-FINDING BEHAVIOR; CULTURAL TRANSMISSION; PIGEONS; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; DIFFUSION; BIRDS; TUTOR	Parent-offspring transmission is usually thought to be the major route for cultural learning. We tested this assumption in ringdoves (Streptopelia risoria), a flock feeding Columbid that is easily raised in captivity. An aviary study first determined the foraging associations of juveniles placed with their sibling, their parents and a pair of non-kin adults. Juveniles foraged more often with kin than with non-kin and joined food discoveries in proportion to these foraging associations; aggression was relatively rare and came more often from unrelated adults than from parents. Two cage experiments showed that parents were not copied more often than unrelated adults when the two tutor types provided different, but equally productive, solutions to a feeding problem. Neither the ingestion of unfamiliar food (two seed types the juveniles had never encountered) nor the learning of a new food searching skill (opening a box containing seed) showed a differential effect of father versus non-kin tutors. Animals that scramble compete for food may thus acquire social information from whatever knowledgeable individuals are present, whether these are kin, unrelated conspecifics or heterospecifics.

Generally, few individuals actively take part in prey immobilization events, biting mostly on fly's legs (body segments which promote vibrations strong enough to attract spiders, but not to dissuade attacks). However, many spiders usually take part in the consumption of this medium size prey item. During the consumption phase appendages were rarely used, probably due to the higher nutritional value and biomass availability of central body segments (thorax, abdomen and head). Non-aggressive contests over displaced prey body parts were frequently seen during collective feeding in natural colonies, but not in small artificial groups in laboratory.

Models predict that social information becomes less reliable in uncertain environments, and therefore animals should reduce their use of social information in these environments; however, these parameters are often difficult to manipulate and control. We investigated how information reliability and environmental uncertainty affect the use of both social and nonsocial signals. Captive blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata, were given a choice between two perches, one of which was rewarded. Jays could see either a social signal (a conspecific) or a nonsocial signal (a light) that provided some information about the rewarded perch. The nonsocial signal was yoked to the bird that generated the social signal, ensuring the two signals were of identical reliability. We manipulated signal reliability (i.e. the probability that the signal correctly indicated the rewarded perch) and environmental certainty (i.e. the probability that a given perch was rewarded). Qualitatively, jays used both social and nonsocial signals more often when the signals were reliable, and used them less often when environments were predictable. However, jays used social signals less than equally reliable nonsocial signals when environments were unpredictable. Our results suggest that signal reliability and environmental predictability interact to determine signal use, but they do not affect social and nonsocial signals in the same way.

Quorum Decision-Making in Foraging Fish Shoals	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INFORMATION-TRANSFER; PUBLIC INFORMATION; STRATEGIES; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; ACCURACY; ANIMALS; SPEED; SIZE	Quorum responses provide a means for group-living animals to integrate and filter disparate social information to produce accurate and coherent group decisions. A quorum response may be defined as a steep increase in the probability of group members performing a given behaviour once a threshold minimum number of their group mates already performing that behaviour is exceeded. In a previous study we reported the use of a quorum response in group decision-making of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) under a simulated predation threat. Here we examine the use of quorum responses by shoals of sticklebacks in first locating and then leaving a foraging patch. We show that a quorum rule explains movement decisions by threespine sticklebacks toward and then away from a food patch. Following both to and from a food patch occurred when a threshold number of initiators was exceeded, with the threshold being determined by the group size.	[Ward, Ashley J.

The question of which competitive tactic should be used has been addressed from two different perspectives: a simple optimality approach and a game theoretic approach. Surprisingly both approaches make strikingly different predictions about how per-capita frequency of aggression within groups should change as a function of food abundance and competitor density. Resource defense theory typically predicts dome-shaped relationships between the per-capita frequency of aggression and both food abundance and competitor density, whereas game theoretic models predict an increase in aggression with competitor density and a decline in aggression with increased food abundance. We developed a game theoretic model to explore whether the predictions of resource defense theory and the game theoretic approach can be reconciled. Our model assumes that players have different competitive abilities and can adopt roles of either finder or joiner that affect the quantity of food that can be gained front a food clump. In accordance with earlier game theoretic models, we predict an increase in aggression with competitor density when animals compete by pair-wise contests. However, when food clumps can be challenged by more than one competitor, both the costs and benefits of defending increase with competitor density, which results in a dome-shaped relationship between the two variables. Our model predicts that aggression should always decrease as the density of food clumps increases.

However, the issue of how the interactions between multiple foragers influence their search efficiency is still not completely understood. To address this, we consider a model to study the optimal strategy for a group of foragers searching for targets distributed heterogeneously. In our model, foragers move on a square lattice containing immobile but regenerative targets. At any instant, a forager is able to detect only those targets that happen to be in the same site. However, we allow the foragers to have information about the state of other foragers. A forager who has not detected any target walks towards the nearest location, where another forager has detected a target, with a probability exp(-alpha d), where d is the distance between the foragers and a is a parameter characterizing the propensity of the foragers to aggregate. The model reveals that neither overcrowding (alpha -> 0) nor independent searching (alpha -> infinity) is beneficial for the foragers. For a patchy distribution of targets, the efficiency is maximum for intermediate values of alpha. In addition, in the limit alpha -> 0, the length of the walks can become scale-free.

Using PIT-tag data to study foraging behaviour in individual bats, we tested short-tailed fruit bats, Catania perspicillata (Linnaeus). for evidence of local enhancement or social facilitation. To discriminate between these phenomena. we manipulated the presence of conspecifics while individuals searched for food. We quantified the time to find food and the order and sex of bats accessing the food, and any consistent associations between bats. Presence of conspecifics decreased the time needed to find food. We found no evidence that pairs of individuals consistently fed together; however, bats of the same sex tended to feed closer in time with one another. The same individuals consistently accessed the food first, and males found food more quickly than females. Our results provide evidence of social facilitation, with bats finding food more quickly in a group than alone.

Some rats brought back food pellets to the cage (divers) while the others (non-divers) stayed in the sole home cage and obtained food only by stealing it from divers. In this study, we elaborated a more complex diving-for-food device which allowed divers to consume the food in a second cage away from non-divers. As a result, the expected lack of suppliers should not allow the emergence of the non-diver status. Unexpectedly, our results showed the apparition of non-divers and the persistence of divers (divers cl) bringing food back to the initial cage. Two new categories of rats appear: individuals which consume the food in the second cage where they stay once they have reached it (divers c2), or occasionally go back to the initial cage throughout the experiment (divers clc2). Our results show the influence of spatial environment on social organization of rats and suggest that social pressure strongly determines the emergence of specialized roles in a group.

Recent work indicates that partner choice can select for high levels of helping. More generally, helping can be seen as but one strategy used to compete for partners within a broader biological market, yet giving within such markets has received little mathematical investigation. In the present model, individuals help others to attract attention from them and thus receive a larger share of any help actively or passively provided by those others. The evolutionarily stable level of helping increases with the size of the biological market and the degree of partner choice. Furthermore, if individuals passively produce some no-cost help to partners, competitive helping can then invade populations of non-helpers because helpers directly benefit from increasing their access to potential partners. This framework of competitive helping demonstrates how high helping can be achieved and why different populations may differ in helping levels. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We examined whether wild blackbirds, Turdus merula, were more likely to choose the richer (20-fold) of two seminatural food patches if they had seen other blackbirds (demonstrators) feeding in them beforehand. There was no evidence that birds having such preharvest public information preferentially selected the richer patch, even if their choice was not limited by the continuing presence of dominant demonstrators. Nor did patch selectors favour the patch occupied by a demonstrator (or just vacated by one) despite an above-average probability that these patches were the richer. Instead, our birds often showed preferences for one or other of the otherwise identical patch locations, were more likely to select the rich patch if it had not changed location since their last visit, and avoided dominant conspecifics. We conclude that preharvest public information has little or no influence on blackbird patch choice decisions. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

In this study we report on the variation in size of spiders from 27 colonies of A. jabaquara, collected during one year. We also conducted an experiment under laboratory conditions to test if prey size, and consequently, collective or individual capture behaviours, influence the establishment of weight differences. Female size variation within colonies was high, increasing slightly from March to September. However, from November to January the variation was much lower, probably as a consequence of the emigration of large spiders during the reproductive period. Spiders that fed on large flies in the laboratory experiment grew more and collective feeding seemed to induce a larger variation in weight among individuals. These results indicate that collective feeding promotes an unequal distribution of food in A. jabaquara colonies.

We measured the feeding rate, diet diversity, individual and seasonal feeding preferences and dominance in birds. Producing and scrounging were frequently observed and they often involved aggressive interactions. Most birds used both tactics to obtain food. We found that foraging method was not related to dominance. No significant differences in feeding rate and diet diversity were detected between dominant and subordinate birds. The Alpine Accentors showed a strong degree of heterogenity in their food specialisations in different seasons. Calculations of nutritive values of diet showed that birds received relatively more carbohydrates in the autumn than in spring or winter. In the "snowy" seasons, the diet contained a relatively high number of lipids. Birds also had significant individual food preferences.

When current information is unreliable, however, selection should favour unresponsive behavioural phenotypes, which might lead to the emergence of personalities. We tested the hypothesis that personality will affect decision making when information is unreliable, but not when it is reliable. We measured two personality traits, boldness and anxiety, in 55 wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, by quantifying responses to a novel food and a mild threat, respectively, in repeated field experiments. To assess decision making under different information reliabilities, we recorded foraging decisions in two contexts. We followed the baboons as they foraged naturally with reliable information about their environment (>8900 decisions) and, to manipulate information reliability experimentally, we performed a large-scale in situ foraging experiment during which we provided the study troops with access to experimental food patches (>10 000 decisions). Importantly, the baboons could not see the food in the experimental patches until close inspection of them, and thus had unreliable information about patch quality. We found plastic foraging decisions in the presence of reliable cues, but personality-dependent decisions in the absence of such cues. Specifically, bold individuals were more likely to produce, and shy individuals scrounge, in the experimental arena but there was no effect of personality on foraging decisions under natural foraging conditions. Our results clarify the importance of information reliability in the evolution of personality and plasticity. These findings also contribute to our understanding of how individuals, and thus populations, might respond to environmental change in the future.

Models of this category-assuming that in groups food finding by one results in food sharing by many-conclude that patch-finding rate improves with group size. In our modification interference among individuals reduces pooled searching efficiency of the group. We introduce a term, s, the probability of an individual's being among the ones sharing the food in a patch found by the group. Not unexpectedly, these fine-tunings prolong food-finding rates that push individuals in the group toward the foraging status of a solitary individual. With phenotype-related differences in s, foraging in groups turns out to be a less profitable option the lower an individual is ranked in the group. The model suggests that, in terms of food finding, individuals have to pay attention to their performance in the foraging group. The option of foraging alone may easily be a better strategy than that of a low-ranking individual foraging in a group. If so, the model also suggests groups assorted by phenotype.

J	Lendvai, AZ; Liker, A; Barta, Z				Lendvai, Adam Z.; Liker, Andras; Barta, Zoltan			The effects of energy reserves and dominance on the use of social-foraging strategies in the house sparrow	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Article							LONCHURA-PUNCTULATA; PASSER-DOMESTICUS; CAPTIVE FLOCKS; SCROUNGER USE; PRODUCER; GAME; BEHAVIOR; FINCHES; TACTICS; RISK	In social animals, dominance rank often influences individuals' behaviour, but in most cases it is unknown how dominance modulates the effects of other phenotypic traits. We investigated the mutual effects of social dominance and the level of energy reserves on the use of social-foraging strategies in captive flocks of house sparrows, Passer domesticus. We used experimental wind exposure to manipulate overnight energy expenditure of dominant and subordinate individuals. In response to the experimental treatment dominants used scrounging (exploiting others' food finding) significantly more, whereas for subordinates there was only a moderate and nonsignificant increase in scrounging. Individual variability in the frequency of scrounging was higher in subordinates than in dominants and this difference between the dominance groups was unaffected by the treatment. These results suggest that individuals of different dominance status adopt different strategies: to cope with an energetically challenging situation, dominants behave rather uniformly by increasing further their preference for scrounging, whereas subordinates do not alter their tactic, but may rely on using scrounging opportunistically.

J	Hamilton, IM				Hamilton, IM			Recruiters and joiners: Using optimal skew theory to predict group size and the division of resources within groups of social foragers	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						optimal skew theory; social foraging; predation risk; foraging; efficiency; dominance	REPRODUCTIVE SKEW; ANIMAL SOCIETIES; HOUSE SPARROWS; COMMON RAVENS; FISH; FLOCKS; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; PREDATORS; MODEL	I apply skew theory to the division of resources within multimember social Foraging and antipredator groups. Resource division is modeled as a game between an individual controlling resources (recruiter) and a potential joiner to the group. If a recruiter benefits from the presence of a joiner, it will allocate sufficient resources to the joiner so that the joiner gains as much from group foraging as it would from foraging alone. Joiners should receive a greater proportion of resources controlled by the recruiter when benefits to grouping are low. If group success is a concave-down function of group size, this Framework carl be used to predict the stable group size. The stable group size is larger than the optimal group size, given equal division of resources, and smaller than the stable group size, given equal division of resources. Furthermore, both current group members and potential joiners agree on the stable group size, 50 long as the recruiter is able to control resource division. If the recruiter cannot control resource division, there may be conflict over group size and the opportunity for group members to contribute less to group success than they are able.

To determine whether red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra) use public information to aid their patch departure decisions, we conducted experiments that compared the sampling behavior of crossbills foraging on a two-patch system (one patch was always empty, one patch containing seeds) when alone, in pairs, and in flocks of three. When foraging alone, crossbills departed from empty patches in a way that was qualitatively consistent with energy maximization. We found evidence for the use of public information when crossbills were paired with two flock mates, but not when paired with one flock mate. When foraging with two flock mates, crossbills sampled approximately half the number of cones on the empty patch before departing as compared to when solitary Furthermore, as expected if public information is used, the variance in both the number of cones and time spent on the empty patch decreased when crossbills foraged with two flock mates as compared to when alone. Although high frequencies of scrounging reduce the availability of public information, scrounging is usually uncommon in crossbills, apparently because they exploit divisible patches. Consequently, public information is likely to be important to crossbills in the wild. We also show that feeding performance is greatly diminished when the assortative grouping by phenotype when phenotypes affect feeding performance, which may in turn promote speciation in some groups of animals.

J	Stenberg, M; Persson, A				Stenberg, M; Persson, A			The effects of spatial food distribution and group size on foraging behaviour in a benthic fish	BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES			English	Article						patch quality; assessment; resource distribution; group foraging	PATCH USE; BAYESIAN FORAGERS; PREDATION RISK; SHOAL SIZE; CHOICE; MODEL; SCROUNGERS; PRODUCERS; ENCOUNTER; SCALE	Animals foraging in heterogeneous environments benefit from information on local resource density because it allows allocation of foraging effort to rich patches. In foraging groups, this information may be obtained by individuals through sampling or by observing the foraging behaviour of group members. We studied the foraging behaviour of goldfish (Carassius auratus) groups feeding in pools on resources distributed in patches. First, we determined if goldfish use sampling information to distinguish between patches of different qualities, and if this allowed goldfish to benefit from a heterogeneous resource distribution. Then, we tested if group size affected the time dedicated to food searching and ultimately foraging success. The decision of goldfish to leave a patch was affected by whether or not they found food, indicating that goldfish use an assessment rule. Giving-up density was higher when resources were highly heterogeneous, but overall gain was not affected by resource distribution. We did not observe any foraging benefits of larger groups, which indicate that grouping behaviour was driven by risk dilution. In larger groups the proportion searching for food was lower, which suggests interactions among group members. We conclude that competition between group members affects individual investments in food searching by introducing the possibility for alternative strategies, such as scrounging or resource monopolisation.

Research on the producerscrounger game has focused mainly on the different factors influencing its evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) solution, but very little is known about the actual mechanisms that shape players' decisions. Recent work has shown that early experience can affect producerscrounger foraging tendencies in young house sparrows and that in nutmeg mannikins learning is involved in reaching the ESS. Here, we show that direct manipulation of the success rate experienced by adult sparrows when following others can change their strategy choice on the following day. We presented to live sparrows an experimental regime, where stuffed adult house sparrows in a feeding position were positioned on a foraging grid that included two reward regimes: a positive one, in which the stuffed models were placed near food, and a negative one, in which the models were placed away from food. There was a significant increase in joining behavior after the positive treatment (exhibited by 84% of the birds), but no change after the negative treatment. Further analysis demonstrated that sparrows more frequently used the strategy with which they were more successful (usually joining) and that differences in strategy use were correlated with differences in success. These results suggest that adult birds can monitor their success and learn to choose among social foraging strategies in the producerscrounger game.

Philoponella vittata form aggregates using other spider's webs as support for their small orbs. In this study we investigated the individuals' spatial distribution relative to their size, the relation between spider abundance and success of prey capture, and the frequency of individuals capturing prey in central and peripheral positions, in webs constructed by four host species. Smaller individuals were found mainly in the peripheral positions and, in central positions, small and large individuals occurred in a frequency that was, respectively, lower and higher than the expected. The percentage of spiders consuming prey, however, had no relation to spider density and position. This suggests that the distribution pattern could be determined by factors other than food availability, such as the avoidance of parasitism and predation.

It has been repeatedly predicted by theory that to benefit must from schooling, individuals should associate together non-randomly according to their phenotype. Obeying the predictions of theory, several fish species exhibit size-assortative schooling in the laboratory, but unequivocal evidence for size-assorted schools in the wild in largely lacking. To ascertain the existence of size-assorted schools in the wild, we quantified the body-size distribution of individuals in schools of wild threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a species that is known to readily from size-assorted schools under experimental conditions. Data were collected from 24 separate schools of juvenile fish in late summer 1994. The fish in those wild schools were size-assorted, confirming the previous laboratory findings and, in accordance with current theory, suggesting that the phenotypic characteristic of individuals may ha of importance when schools are formed.
