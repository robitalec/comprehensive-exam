This is due to the finders share that lets producers pay more for defense than a scrounger can for appropriation.   Increasing group size will increase the rate of playing scrounger and increase the costs of aggression. Few scroungers are expected at the equilibrium when the number of foragers is small.   Increasing patch density will reduce the time required for producers to find patches and the temporal costs associated with aggressive appropriation will make scrounger less profitable. Encounters will decline as the number of producers increases.   Increasing patch richness will increase the scrounger's share and the proportion of scroungers within the group. Scroungers are more likely to get required food to offset expenses of aggressive appropriation.   Costs of aggression increase with predation pressure as the increased probability of being killed by a predator while engaged in a fight increase. Aggression should reduce when predation hazard increases but non-aggressive scroungers will be unsuccessful securing food from aggressive producers. Otherwise, scroungers are likely to switch to producing, reducing the proportion of scroungers and decreasing the number of challenges but with lower numbers of scroungers, the aggressiveness increases."

If patches were easy to find and individuals were unable to monopolize resources, scrounging became less common. Under conditions of strong monopolization and intermediate discovery rates, higher levels of scrounging occurred.   Two main predictions: 1 The effects of resource scarcity on social information use should depend on resource monopolizability. 2 The potential benefits of social dominance should be closely linked to social information use in uncertain environments.   There are constrains that competition imposes on an individual's ability to use social information to access resources. When resources are monopolizable, social information use may become exclusive to dominant individuals leading to a positive relationship between social rank and resource acquisition rate.    Selection pressures on dominance will depend on multidimensional aspects of resources eg. scarcity, depletion rate and monopolizability"

Scrounging in the top predator of a tritrophic food chain can stabilize interactions between the top predator, its prey and its prey's prey. Presence of scroungers reduces the total amount of resource acquired by the group. Scrounging limits group size, impact on prey and ability of a predator to outcompete other species, promoting stability and species diversity.   Higher growth rates of the resource require high scrounging frequencies to prevent instability on the system. Low growth rates allow coexistence only when the finder's advantage is high and scrounging frequency is low. If encounter rate is high, scrounging will be rare.    Scrounging will not stabilize population dynamics, food chains and competitor interactions under all cases. If scrounging is too prevalent, it can push the population to extinction.
