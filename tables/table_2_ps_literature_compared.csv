Scrounging is a variance-averse strategy and is less sensitive to changes in patch quality variance than average patch quality. Learning rule models are better tools, to handle complex situations and in their simplicity, to study and predict animal behaviour in frequency-dependent systems than the evolutionarily stable strategy approach. Agent based models using learning rules can incorporate multiple ecological parameters to describe environments more realistically."

In larger patch sizes fish have a reduced finder's share and tend to scrounge more often. In smaller patch sizes fish rely on private information, solitary foraging. Payoffs were higher for fish that produced in all environmental conditions, likely due in part to consistent interindividual differences in foraging efficiency and body size"

Fasted sparrows risked being more exploratory and stayed longer on the ground. Fasted sparrows discovered more patches and consumed more food than fed sparrows in dispersed patch patterns. Fed birds increased patch finding to a plateau in dispersed patch patterns.

Individual specialization on producing and scrounging. Females and adults were more likely to scrounge than males and juveniles. Tolerance in males for female scroungers may be related mating pairs, and dominance of males giving a tendency to produce.

Do scrounging herbivores use the finder's share obtained by a producer as a cue for making patch joining decisions? How does the influence of finder's share on patch joining decisions vary with food availability in a patch?","At low and intermediate food availability, scrounging goats avoided the finder's share patch once the producer had fed for >= 30s. At the highest food availability, scrounging goats joined the producer up to 120s. Food availability and finder's share are both considered by animals making scrounging decisions but finder's share is less important in patches with more food."
