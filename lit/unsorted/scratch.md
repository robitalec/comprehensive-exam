# Scratch

## Currencies
- Frequency independent (Stephens Krebs)
	- Max
	- Min
- Frequency depedent (Maynard Smith 1982)
	- Stability

## Fitness
Allee effects

### Negative
Parasite load

## Social foraging theory
### Producer-scrounger dynamics
"Scrounging payoffs are negatively frequency dependent"

## Habitat
- resources
- risks
- conditions
### Resources
Resources
- depletable
- not



## Learning

## Memory



## Niche
### Fundamental niche
### Realized niche


## Scale

### Levels
- Individual
	- Stephens Krebs
- Dyad, group
	- SFT
	- Producer scrounger
- Species, populations
	- SHA
	- Habitat selection
	- SDM
- Multispecies
	- SHA

### Individual
- mobility
- spatial scales of perception

## Game theory
Rules for game theory eg 2.1.3.3

## Plasticity

## Individual differences

## Outcomes
ESS
Fitness
Population dynamics

## Approach
### Mechanistic
Social foraging theory
Explicit consideration of payoffs and penalties

### Empirical
Species distribution models, species habitat associations

## Queries
- How does habitat selection relate to individuals?
- State of "niche" as a concept?
- Clarify fitness assumptions?
- What is random movement?
- How is "causality" considered for species-habitat associations?
- How is social foraging theory different than individual foraging theory?
	- Examples
- What are aggregration and dispersion economies?
- How do producer scrounger dynamics differ from information sharing?
- What animals exist at high density? At equilibrium?
- How do resources, risks and conditions interact? (table)
- How is density/frequency considered for producer-scrounger games?
- Producer-scrounger dynamics with multiple species?
- How do SHA and SFT differ in their assumptions around fitness?
- Are scales of SHA and SFT related? Habitat selection related to species distribution, which is not the scale of SFT
- Examples of solitary foragers vs group foragers
