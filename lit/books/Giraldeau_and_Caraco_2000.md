## C1: Concepts, definitions, methods

Social foraging differs from individual foraging theory in that it requires economic interdependence of payoffs and penalties. An individual's foraging behaviour and its functional consequence depends on the actions of the individual and the behaviour of other foragers. The majority of this book's attention is on consequences for individuals with some on communities. 

Comparing individual foraging theory, eg. Stephens_and_Krebs_1986, to social foraging theory

| Prey selection strategy for an individual involves attack probabilities for different prey and net rate of intake | Added complexity of considering 2+ predators for a shared clump of prey |
