## C1: The ecology behind species-habitat association models

### 1.2 How do living beings "see" the world around them?

Priority for an organism's fitness and distribution is whether it has a positive, negative or ambivalent relationship with aspects of its environment

Environment = resources + risks + conditions

#### 1.2.1 [resources](../topics/resources.md)

[resources](../topics/resources.md) are substances, objects or places in the environment required by an organism for normal growth, maintenance and reproduction 

Generally, [resources](../topics/resources.md) have a positive effect on fitness:

- (for plants) sunlight, carbon dioxide, minerals, water
- (for animals) prey, water, nesting spaces, resting spaces

In overabundance of [resources](../topics/resources.md) or high density of individuals, [resources](../topics/resources.md) can turn into risk with negative effects on fitness:

- large quantity of food consumed where food is poisonous at high doses
- excess light damaging photosynthetic machinery
- reduced resources due to intraspecific competition (conspecifics) or interspecific competition (heterospecifics)

### 1.2.2 [risks](../topics/risks.md)

[risks](../topics/risks.md) are environmental variables lower the actual or perceived chances of individual survival or reproduction and have a negative effect on [fitness](../topics/fitness.md)

[risks](../topics/risks.md) shape distributions by influencing demographic rates (predation, ultimately death). Perception of risk may be just as influential, see Landre_et_al_2010. 

Presence of risks may limit actual presence of species, eg. where hosts are missing where parasites exist. 

[risks](../topics/risks.md) are often dynamic processes that are difficult to quantify. See Palmer_et_al_2017. 

### 1.2.3 [conditions](../topics/conditions.md)

[conditions](../topics/conditions.md) are environmental variables that surround the organism and influence its functioning. 

- ambient temperature
- salinity
- humidity

[conditions](../topics/conditions.md) can have positive, negative or ambivalent effects on [fitness](../topics/fitness.md). Eg. outside of limits of ambient temperature, organisms can die or stop functioning properly. 

See Oddling_Smee_et_al_2013 for modification of [conditions](../topics/conditions.md) by organisms. 

### 1.2.4 Interactions between [resources](../topics/resources.md), [risks](../topics/risks.md) and [conditions](../topics/conditions.md)

- [resources](../topics/resources.md) - [risks](../topics/risks.md)
	- "Is it worth the risk?" (Brown_and_Kotler_2004)
	- eg. predation risks causing organisms to avoid high resource density areas (McNammara_and_Houston_1987)
	- Surviving individuals in areas of high risk will have lower resource competition which may lead to an increase in overall population fitness (Van_Leeuwen_et_al_2008)
- [resources](../topics/resources.md) - [conditions](../topics/conditions.md)
	- Environmental conditions influence on detection and intake of resources
	- eg. depth and sediment type on accessibility of marine invertebrates to predators (De_Goeij_and_Honkoop_2022)
- [risks](../topics/risks.md) - [conditions](../topics/conditions.md)
	- eg. detection risk of prey by predator given canopy cover (Brown_and_Koetler_2004)
- [resources](../topics/resources.md) - [risks](../topics/risks.md) - [conditions](../topics/conditions.md)
	- eg. warm blooded marine mammals in polar environments, balancing risk of hypothermia with prey resource under cold temperature conditions (Grady_et_al_2019)

### 1.3 What is a [habitat](../topics/habitat.md)?

Recommendation is at the outset of an analysis, define [habitat](../topics/habitat.md) as a point in environmental space whose dimensions are environmental variables ([resources](../topics/resources.md), [risks](../topics/risks.md), [conditions](../topics/conditions.md)). This [habitat](../topics/habitat.md) is aspatial and species agnostic but can be used to map onto geographic space and/or determine species specific associations. 

1. Is habitat a place or a set of circumstances?

A region in space intuitively captures the environmental variables. However this perspective has methodological disadvantages:
- requires space to be divided apriori into parts which presents challenges given nested spatial scales
- scale depends on species' mobility and perception
- environment is dynamic, changing seasonally or abruptly given anthropogenic or natural drivers
- models specific to one location can be challenging to use for predictions to new locations

2. Should habitat comprise just conditions or also include resources and risks?

For distribution of moving animals, resource selection functions (Manly_et_al_2002) initially included only food selection, later also incorporated conditions and risks. 

All three types of environmental variables ([resources](../topics/resources.md), [risks](../topics/risks.md) and [conditions](../topics/conditions.md)) ultimately influence fitness and distribution. Complex interactions between them prevent considering them in total isolation. Therefore, the definition of [habitat](../topics/habitat.md) necessarily includes all three. 

3. Is habitat specific specific or independent?

Problems with specific specific definitions of habitat:

- it is unknown apriori which environmental variables will be relevant to any focal species
- the inferred relationship between species and habitat is not binary and models must allow for gradients of suitability

### 1.4 What is a species-habitat association?

A species-habitat association connects habitats to observations of a species
