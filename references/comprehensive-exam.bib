  abstract = {The ``social intelligence hypothesis'' states that the need to cope with complexities of social life has driven the evolution of advanced cognitive abilities. It is usually invoked in the context of challenges arising from complex intragroup structures, hierarchies, and alliances. However, a fundamental aspect of group living remains largely unexplored as a driving force in cognitive evolution: the competition between individuals searching for resources (producers) and conspecifics that parasitize their findings (scroungers). In populations of social foragers, abilities that enable scroungers to steal by outsmarting producers, and those allowing producers to prevent theft by outsmarting scroungers, are likely to be beneficial and may fuel a cognitive arms race. Using analytical theory and agent-based simulations, we present a general model for such a race that is driven by the producer\textendash scrounger game and show that the race's plausibility is dramatically affected by the nature of the evolving abilities. If scrounging and scrounging avoidance rely on separate, strategy-specific cognitive abilities, arms races are short-lived and have a limited effect on cognition. However, general cognitive abilities that facilitate both scrounging and scrounging avoidance undergo stable, long-lasting arms races. Thus, ubiquitous foraging interactions may lead to the evolution of general cognitive abilities in social animals, without the requirement of complex intragroup structures.},

  abstract = {In many ecological situations, resources are difficult to find but become more apparent to nearby searchers after one of their numbers discovers and begins to exploit them. If the discoverer cannot monopolize the resources, then others may benefit from joining the discoverer and sharing their discovery. Existing theories for this type of conspecific attraction have often used very simple rules for how the decision to join a discovered resource patch should be influenced by the number of individuals already exploiting that patch. We use a mechanistic, spatially explicit model to demonstrate that individuals should not necessarily simply join patches more often as the number of individuals exploiting the patch increases, because those patches are likely to be exhausted soon or joining them will intensify future local competition. Furthermore, we show that this decision should be sensitive to the nature of the resource patches, with individuals being more responsive to discoveries in general and more tolerant of larger numbers of existing exploiters on a patch when patches are resource-rich and challenging to locate alone. As such, we argue that this greater focus on underlying joining mechanisms suggests that conspecific attraction is a more sophisticated and flexible tactic than currently appreciated.},

  abstract = {The formation of foraging groups is likely to result from individual decisions constrained by spatial distribution of food and number of foragers. Foraging groups may form via different mechanisms depending on the absolute levels of at least two relative spatial scales. I present four group size models for environments composed of two nested patch scales. Second-order patches contain first-order patches that correspond to food patches. Individuals within a given second-order patch are able to monitor their conspecifics' behavior, and the number of individuals attending a first-order patch defines group size. I then test the models' predictions with Parasitic Jaegers (Stercorarius parasiticus) kleptoparasitizing fish from Common Terns (Sterna hirundo). In this context, tern fishing grounds and flying terns that carried fish correspond to the jaegers' second and first-order patches, respectively. The Dispersion and Aggregation models assume that foragers have perfect knowledge of the spatial distribution of food and form groups in conformity to an ideal free distribution. The Producer\textendash Scrounger (PS) and Information-Sharing (IS) models, however, assume that foragers are unaware of the food patches' location and form groups as some foragers join and exploit the food discoveries of others. I used four fitness currencies: probability of obtaining a fish, PF; gross and net rates of energy intake; and energy efficiency. All currencies decreased with group size except the PF currency, which did not vary for group sizes of one and two. Because fitness never increased with group size, the Aggregation model was ruled out. Fish-securing rates of jaegers that initiated and joined chases did not differ. Assuming that initiating and joining a chase correspond to a producing and a scrounging event, respectively, both the PS and IS model then predict that group size should match jaeger abundance. Because group size leveled rapidly with jaeger abundance, both models were discarded. The Dispersion model predicts that group size should decrease with an increase in tern availability when the latter is limiting. Otherwise, jaegers should not form groups unless there is no cost to do so, such as with the PF currency in which solitary jaegers and pairs experience equal fitness. The facts that group size did not reach 1.0 at high tern availability and that it averaged 1.5 when it did not decrease further with tern availability suggest that jaegers may form groups according to the Dispersion model with the PF currency. This conclusion is discussed in relation to the other assumptions underlying the Dispersion model.},

If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence to more joining by foragers. We tested this prediction as well as the extent to which stationary birds use head up exclusively for antipredatory purposes and hopping birds use head up for foraging purposes only. We observed three flocks of nutmeg mannikins searching for hidden clumps of food in an indoor aviary. We used a 2\texttimes 2 factorial design in which both the distance to a safe refuge and the food distribution were manipulated. The use of head up by stationary and eating birds increased significantly with increased distance to cover. Distance to cover, however, had no effect on the use of the scrounger tactic or on the level of joining. We found no evidence of compatibility between the scrounger tactic and antipredatory vigilance. Our results provide the first unambiguous evidence for the existence of two distinct and incompatible patterns of vigilance for predators and for conspecifics.

  abstract = {Behavioural decisions in a social context commonly have frequency-dependent outcomes and so require analysis using evolutionary game theory. Learning provides a mechanism for tracking changing conditions and it has frequently been predicted to supplant fixed behaviour in shifting environments; yet few studies have examined the evolution of learning specifically in a game-theoretic context. We present a model that examines the evolution of learning in a frequency-dependent context created by a producer\textendash scrounger game, where producers search for their own resources and scroungers usurp the discoveries of producers. We ask whether a learning mutant that can optimize its use of producer and scrounger to local conditions can invade a population of non-learning individuals that play producer and scrounger with fixed probabilities. We find that learning provides an initial advantage but never evolves to fixation. Once a stable equilibrium is attained, the population is always made up of a majority of fixed players and a minority of learning individuals. This result is robust to variation in the initial proportion of fixed individuals, the rate of within- and between-generation environmental change, and population size. Such learning polymorphisms will manifest themselves in a wide range of contexts, providing an important element leading to behavioural syndromes.},

  abstract = {Although natural selection should have favoured individuals capable of adjusting the weight they give to personal and social information according to circumstances, individuals generally differ consistently in their individual weighting of both types of information. Such individual differences are correlated with personality traits, suggesting that personality could directly affect individuals' ability to collect personal or social information. Alternatively, the link between personality and information use could simply emerge as a by-product of the sequential decision-making process in a frequency-dependent context. Indeed, when the gains associated with behavioural options depend on the choices of others, an individual's sequence of arrival could constrain its choice of options leading to the emergence of correlated behaviours. Any factor such as personality that affects decision order could thus be correlated with information use. To test this new explanation, we developed an individual-based model that simulates a group of animals engaged in a game of sequential frequency-dependent decision: a producer\textendash scrounger game. Our results confirm that the sequence of decision, in this case enforced by the order in which animals enter a foraging area, consistently influences their mean tactic use and their individual plasticity, an outcome reminiscent of the correlation reported between personality and social information use.},

Numerous studies have described group-size effects on group-average feeding behaviour, particularly emphasizing an increase in scrounging incidence for larger groups, where individuals (scroungers) feed from the food sources others (producers) discovered. However, individual variation in feeding behaviour remains unconsidered in the vast majority of these studies even though theoretical models predict individuals to specialize in feeding tactic and anticipate higher scrounger-type frequencies in larger groups. We combined group-level and individual-level analyses of group-size effects on social foraging in the subsocial spider Australomisidia ergandros. Lending novel experimental support to model predictions, we found that individuals specialize in feeding tactic and that higher scrounging and lower producing incidence in larger groups were mediated through shifts in the ratio of feeding types. Further, feeding-type specialization was not explained by innate individual differences in hunting ability as all feeding types were equally efficient in prey capture when foraging alone. Context adaptivity of feeding behaviour might allow this subsocial species to succeed under varying socioecological conditions.},

  abstract = {Group foraging allows the co-existence of a strategy (producer) that involves searching for food, and its alternative (scrounger) exploiting the food of the producer. The use of producer and scrounger strategies has been modelled as an alternative-option scramble which assumes strong negative frequency-dependence of the scrounger's pay-offs. We tested this assumption in a flock feeding situation by manipulating the proportion of scroungers in flocks of spice finches, Lonchura punctulata. In a first experiment we found that: (1) the foodintake of scroungers, and to a lesser extent producers, was negatively affected by an increase in the proportion of scroungers; (2) the food intake of producers and scroungers was equal when the proportion of scroungers was small, suggesting that producers, who exploited 35.4\% of their patches by scrounging were opportunistically adjusting their use of the strategies until the pay-offs equalized. In a second experiment we tested whether finches could vary their use of the two strategies in response to changes in foraging conditions brought about by an increase in the cost of producing. As predicted by the game, finches reduced their use of the producer strategy and increased their use of the scrounger strategy when the cost of producing increased. These results suggest that spice finches can alter their allocation to each foraging alternative by experience and that the producerscrounger game is a realistic model for predicting group foraging decisions.},

While it is well known that vultures use intraspecific social information as they forage, the possibility of inter-guild social information transfer and the resulting multi-species social dilemmas has not been explored. Here, we use data on arrival times at carcasses to show that such social information transfer occurs, with raptors acting as producers of information and vultures acting as scroungers of information. We develop a game-theoretic model to show that competitive asymmetry, whereby vultures dominate raptors at carcasses, predicts this evolutionary outcome. We support this theoretical prediction using empirical data from competitive interactions at carcasses. Finally, we use an individual-based model to show that these producer\textendash scrounger dynamics lead to vultures being vulnerable to declines in raptor populations. Our results show that social information transfer can lead to important non-trophic interactions among species and highlight important potential links among social evolution, community ecology and conservation biology. With vulture populations suffering global declines, our study underscores the importance of ecosystem-based management for these endangered keystone species.},

While producers rely on personal information and past experience, we may ask whether the tendency to forage as a producer is related to being a better learner. To answer this question, we hand-raised house sparrow (               Passer domesticus               ) nestlings that upon independence were given an individual-learning task that required them to associate colour signal and food presence. Following the testing phase, all fledglings were released into a shared aviary, and their social-foraging tendencies were measured. We found a significant positive correlation between individual's performance in the individual-learning task and subsequent tendency to use searching (producing) behaviour. Individual-learning score was negatively correlated with initial fear of the test apparatus and with body weight. However, the correlation between individual learning and searching remained significant after controlling for these variables. Since it was measured before the birds entered a social group, individual-learning ability could not be the outcome of being a producer. However, the two traits may be initially associated, or individual learning could facilitate producing behaviour. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that associates individual-learning abilities with social-foraging strategies in animal groups.},

While experimental evidence in the producer\textendash scrounger game suggests that learned strategy choice may be common, a recent theoretical analysis demonstrated that learning by only some individuals prevents learning from evolving in others. Here, however, we model learning explicitly, and demonstrate that learning can easily evolve in the whole population. We used an agent-based evolutionary simulation of the producer\textendash scrounger game to test the success of two general learning rules for strategy choice. We found that learning was eventually acquired by all individuals under a sufficient degree of environmental fluctuation, and when players were phenotypically asymmetric. In the absence of sufficient environmental change or phenotypic asymmetries, the correct target for learning seems to be confounded by game dynamics, and innate strategy choice is likely to be fixed in the population. The results demonstrate that under biologically plausible conditions, learning can easily evolve in the whole population and that phenotypic asymmetry is important for the evolution of learned strategy choice, especially in a stable or mildly changing environment.},

  abstract = {Animals foraging in groups can either search for food themselves (producing) or search for the food discoveries of other individuals (scrounging). Tactic use in producer\textendash scrounger games is partly flexible but individuals tend to show consistency in tactic use under different conditions suggesting that personality might play a role in tactic use in producer\textendash scrounger games. Here we studied the use of producing and scrounging tactics by bold and shy barnacle geese (               Branta leucopsis               ), where boldness is a personality trait known to be repeatable over time in this species. We defined individuals as bold, shy or intermediate based on two novel object tests. We scored the frequency of finding food patches (the outcome of investing in producing) and joining patches (the outcome of investing in scrounging) by bold and shy individuals and their feeding time. Shy individuals had a higher frequency of joining than bold individuals, demonstrating for the first time that personality is associated with tactic use in a producer\textendash scrounger game. Bold individuals tended to spend more time feeding than shy individuals. Our results highlight the importance of including individual behavioural variation in models of producer\textendash scrounger games.},

  abstract = {Organisms need access to particular habitats for their survival and reproduction. However, even if all necessary habitats are available within the broader environment, they may not all be easily reachable from the position of a single individual. Many species distribution models consider populations in environmental (or niche) space, hence overlooking this fundamental aspect of geographical accessibility. Here, we develop a formal way of thinking about habitat availability in environmental spaces by describing how limitations in accessibility can cause animals to experience a more limited or simply different mixture of habitats than those more broadly available. We develop an analytical framework for characterizing constrained habitat availability based on the statistical properties of movement and environmental autocorrelation. Using simulation experiments, we show that our general statistical representation of constrained availability is a good approximation of habitat availability for particular realizations of landscape-organism interactions. We present two applications of our approach, one to the statistical analysis of habitat preference (using step-selection functions to analyze harbor seal telemetry data) and a second that derives theoretical insights about population viability from knowledge of the underlying environment. Analytical expressions for habitat availability, such as those we develop here, can yield gains in analytical speed, biological realism, and conceptual generality by allowing us to formulate models that are habitat sensitive without needing to be spatially explicit.},

  abstract = {When engaged in behavioural games, animals can adjust their use of alternative tactics until groups reach stable equilibria. Recent theory on behavioural plasticity in games predicts that individuals should differ in their plasticity or responsiveness and hence in their degree of behavioural adjustment. Moreover, individuals are predicted to be consistent in their plasticity within and across biological contexts. These predictions have yet to be tested empirically and so we examine the behavioural adjustment of individual nutmeg mannikins (               Lonchura punctulata               ), gregarious ground-feeding passerines, when playing two different social foraging games: producer\textendash scrounger (PS) and patch-choice (PC) games. We found: (i) significant individual differences in plasticity and sampling behaviour in each of the two games, (ii) individual differences in sampling behaviour were consistent over different test conditions within a game (PC) and over a six month period (PS), (iii) but neither individual plasticity nor sampling behaviour was correlated from one social foraging game to another. The rate at which birds sampled alternative tactics was positively associated with seed intake in PS trials but negatively associated in PC trials. These results suggest that games with frequency dependence of pay-offs can maintain differences in behavioural plasticity but that an important component of this plasticity is group- and/or context-specific.},

Diet overlap was greater between C. julis and M. surmuletus in comparison to other combinations. All three species were diurnal feeders, but with diVerent daily patterns of foraging based on diVerent prey availability. There was a general spatio-temporal correlation in non-foraging activity among the three species, but foraging activity was correlated only between C. julis and the other two species, but not between S. cinereus and M. surmuletus .There was heterospecific aggregation during foraging between C. julis and M. surmuletus, and possibly a scrounger\textendash producer relationship between them. Fights between C. julis specimens related to foraging activity were common, but not between species. These results support the view that diVerences in spatio-temporal organization of activity, and interactions during foraging, can contribute to resource partitioning among syntopic populations of fish belonging to the same trophic group.},

  abstract = {In nature, animals often ignore socially available information despite the multiple theoretical benefits of social learning over individual trial-and-error learning. Using information filtered by others is quicker, more efficient and less risky than randomly sampling the environment. To explain the mix of social and individual learning used by animals in nature, most models penalize the quality of socially derived information as either out of date, of poor fidelity or costly to acquire. Competition for limited resources, a fundamental evolutionary force, provides a compelling, yet hitherto overlooked, explanation for the evolution of mixed-learning strategies. We present a novel model of social learning that incorporates competition and demonstrates that (i) social learning is favoured when competition is weak, but (ii) if competition is strong social learning is favoured only when resource quality is highly variable and there is low environmental turnover. The frequency of social learning in our model always evolves until it reduces the mean foraging success of the population. The results of our model are consistent with empirical studies showing that individuals rely less on social information where resources vary little in quality and where there is high within-patch competition. Our model provides a framework for understanding the evolution of social learning, a prerequisite for human cumulative culture.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of resource patches and species that exploit such patches are of interest to ecologists, conservation biologists, modelers, and mathematicians. Here we consider how social interactions can create unique, evolving patterns in space and time. Whereas simple prey taxis (with consumable prey) promotes spatial uniform distributions, here we show that taxis in producer\textendash scrounger groups can lead to pattern formation. We consider two types of foragers: those that search directly (``producers'') and those that exploit other foragers to find food (``scroungers'' or exploiters). We show that such groups can sustain fluctuating spatiotemporal patterns, akin to ``waves of pursuit.'' Investigating the relative benefits to the individuals, we observed conditions under which either strategy leads to enhanced success, defined as net food consumption. Foragers that search for food directly have an advantage when food patches are localized. Those that seek aggregations of group mates do better when their ability to track group mates exceeds the foragers' food-sensing acuity. When behavioral switching or reproductive success of the strategies is included, the relative abundance of foragers and exploiters is dynamic over time, in contrast with classic models that predict stable frequencies. Our work shows the importance of considering two-way interaction\textemdash i.e., how food distribution both influences and is influenced by social foraging and aggregation of predators.},
