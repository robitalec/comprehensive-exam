Table 1 shows the environmental variables considered in the producer-scrounger literature reviewed (Table S1). The variables included are derived from the definition of habitat in @Matthiopoulos_2023: resources, risks and conditions. Only one article examined the influence of conditions [@Ha_2003]. For the influence of risks, producer-scrounger models considered only predation risk in producer-scrounger models [@Barta_2000; @Dubois_2005; @Dubois_2020], empirical tests [@Bugnyar_2002], and the perception of predation in empirical tests [@Barta_2004; @Mathot_2007; @Teichroeb_2015]. The remaining references examine patch related variables of the habitat's resources: patch density, richness, distribution and size. 

Figure 2 shows the graph visualization of all variables directly and indirectly related to the proportion of scrounging behaviour identified in the reviewed literature (Table S1). The variables shown are a subset of the full graph (Figure S1) to focus on the proportion of scrounging in a group. The relationships are also a subset of the full graph, where relationships to other outcome variables are excluded. For example, the relationship between patch richness and rate of aggression [@Dubois_2003] is not shown because the relationship between proportion of scroungers and rate of aggression was not explicitly tested in the reviewed literature. Some variables influencing the proportion of scroungers are related to access and availability of resources. Patch size [@King_2009; @Hansen_2016] and patch distribution [@Dubois_2020; @Ohtsuka_2009] had a positive relationship with proportion of scrounging whereasa patch discovery rate [@Ohtsuka_2009; @Lee_2016], and finder share [@Barta_1998; @Lee_2016] had a negative relationship with proportion of scrounging. Beyond environmental variables, many other individual constraints are found to have influences on the proportion of scrounging including dominance [@Caraco_1989; @Barta_1998; @Bugnyar_2002; @Werdenich_2002; @King_2009; @Lee_2016; @Aplin_2017], energy reserves [@Lendvai_2004; @Lee_2016a], relatedness [@Mathot_2010] and social affiliation [@King_2009]. Predation risks (and proxies to simulate predation risk) were the only form of risk considered in the reviewed producer-scrounger literature (Table 1) and there were conflicting results where @Dubois_2020 's game theoretical approach predicted a negative relationship with scrounging while @Barta_2004 and @Mathot_2007 found a positive relationship.
