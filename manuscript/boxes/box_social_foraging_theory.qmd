title: "Box 1: Social Foraging Theory"

Social foraging theory is the study of multiple individuals influence each other's foraging payoffs and penalties [@Giraldeau_2000]. It extends traditional foraging theory  which focused on prey acquisition, selection and intake rate maximization [@Stephens_1986; @Stephens_2007]. Animal sociality is often described as a balance between advantages and disadvantages [@Krause_2002]. Social foraging theory is not centred on competing causes of sociality. Rather the payoffs and penalties are directly integrated as the currencies of fitness. The criterion for sociality in social foraging theory is that individuals influence each other's costs and benefits [@Giraldeau_2000]. Social foraging takes an game theory approach to determine optimal strategies given the risks and rewards foraging with conspecifics. 

Three kinds of social foraging behaviours are commonly described. Interference represents a negative impact on a forager that does not provide a direct benefit to the conspecific. The result is less food available for the forager without any benefit to the conspecific. This idea is related to the ideal free distribution [@Fretwell_1969] where density of individuals decreases the suitability of a  habitat. The ideal free distribution assumes that individuals are free to move between patches without cost and that individuals behave ideally with perfect information about which patches will maximize their fitness. Typically, interference behaviour is not considering using an evolutionary game theory model because the presence of an individual is not a foraging strategy [@Giraldeau_2000]. 

Kleptoparasitism is when a forager attempts to directly steal food items from a conspecific. Stealing from a conspecific has a direct negative impact on the conspecific and if successful, a positive impact on the forager. It is a behaviour common across taxa [@Broom_2013]. Evolutionary game theory models can be applied to kleptoparasitism to predict the frequency of stealing in a group or population. Kleptoparasitism models often consider food items indivisible and focus on the stages from searching, contest and handling. 

Finally, producer-scrounger dynamics consider foraging behaviours related to searching and sharing forage patches [@Barnard_1981; @Giraldeau_2000]. Producers are individuals that independently search for forage patches and scroungers are individuals that follow producers to share their discovered patches [@Giraldeau_2000; @Broom_2013]. Opportunitists are sometimes also considered as foragers that are able to produce or scrounge albeit less efficiently than producers and scroungers [@Vickery_1991]. 

Many assumptions are involved in different evolutionary game theory models. For example, a scrounger may have limited information about the quantity of food remaining on a patch that a producer has discovered [@Dubois_2007; @Broom_2016]. Food patches can be divided equally among foragers, according when individuals arrive, or according to aggression and dominance [@Caraco_1991; @Broom_2013]. Extensions to producer-scrounger models have incorporated variables related to individuals such as memory and learning, and related to environments such as patch distribution and density [eg. @Giraldeau_2000; @Lendvai_2004; @Smolla_2015; @Dubois_2020; @Vickery_2020]. 

Producer-scrounger models differ in their assumptions and constraints on producer and scrounger payoffs and penalties. One example for scrounger payoffs is where all scroungers attend to all producer's discovered patches and divide the remaining food items equally (after subtracting the finder's share consumed exclusively by the producer) (Giraldeau 2000). The cost for producers depends on the rule defining the relationship between a producer and the number of scroungers in the group. For models that assume the producer-priority rule, the producer's loss is independent on the number of scroungers while for models that assume the scramble-competition rule, the producer's loss increases with the number of scroungers in the group (Giraldeau 2000).

Producer-scrounger models explicitly aim to determine the evolutionarily stable proportions of foraging behaviours in the group considering the frequency dependence of individuals' payoffs [@Giraldeau_2000]. Individuals can only play one of the strategies, producing or scrounging, at any time, and the proportion of individuals playing either strategy directly impacts the payoffs. For example, when the proportion of producers in a group is low, it is disadvantageous to an individual to scrounge because there are few resources being discovered. As the number of producers increases, the profitability of scrounging increases [@Beauchamp_2000a; @Dubois_2005; @Giraldeau_2000]. The benefits for producers are more closely linked to the rate at which they can discover patches but high numbers of scroungers can have a negative effect on producers [@Beauchamp_2000a; @Dubois_2005; @Giraldeau_2000].
