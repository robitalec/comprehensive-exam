title: "Box 3: Individual constraints"
---

Many constraints on individuals were identified in the producer-scrounger literature (Figure S1; Table S1). These can be broadly categorized as metabolic, social demographic, spatial, and learning. 


@Teichroeb_2015 found that vervet monkeys (*Chlorocebus pygerythrus*) balanced the risk of predation with foraging success by modifying their spatial position within the group. Individuals on the edge of the foraging group had higher foraging success while individuals in the center were safer.


Dominance was widely supported as a highly influential variable in producer-scrounger dynamics. Depending on patch distribution, dominant individuals can easily exploit most patches found by conspecific subordinates [@Caraco_1989]. Dominant individuals had better foraging efficiency, and access to forage [@Caraco_1979; @Teichroeb_2015]. Dominant individuals also had a larger finder's share [@Teichroeb_2015]. In game theory models, dominant individuals preferred the scrounger strategy while subordinate individuals preferred the producer strategy [@Barta_1998; @Lee_2016]. In empirical tests, there was disagreement whether dominant individuals were more likely to produce or scrounge. @Aplin_2017 found that male dominant great tits were more likely to produce while in marmosets [@Werdenich_2002], baboons [@King_2009], and juncos [@Caraco_1989] dominant individuals were more likely to scrounge. Depending on resource monopolizabilty, scrounging can also become the exclusive strategy of dominant individuals [@Lee_2016]. 

Energy reserves influenced foraging strategy use. Individuals are predicted to scrounge at dawn when energy reserves are low, then switch to producing near midday, before switching back to scrounging to rest and avoid predation risk [@Barta_2000]. @Barta_2004 found that scrounging was more common when energy reserves were low in tree sparrows. In contrast, @Lee_2016a found the rates of producing and scrounging did not differ depending on fed and fasted states. However, fasted sparrows stayed longer on the ground and consumed more forage than fed sparrows [@Lee_2016a]. @Barta_2004 posit that scrounging is a more variance-averse strategy that allows individuals access to forage more regularly. 

Social affiliation may contribute to tolerance of scroungers or increases in sharing. 
@Mathot_2010 found that producer zebra finches were more tolerant of related scroungers. 
@Bugnyar_2002 found that dyads of ravens were more likely to share if they were also engaged in bonding behaviours such as mutual preening. While not specifically tested, @Aplin_2017 posit that male tolerance of female scroungers may have been due to mating pairs, and found that scroungers had high network centrality. 

Demographic differences including sex and age also had influences on producer-scrounger dynamics. Female great tits [@Aplin_2017] and pregnant baboons [@King_2009] were more likely to scrounge while male great tits [@Aplin_2017] were more likely to produce. @Aplin_2017 found that adults were more likely to produce and juveniles were more likely ot scrounge, but @Teichroeb_2015 found no effect of age. 



<!--
-   Dominance
    - Dominance not as relevant for eg finches than baboons?
    - @Bugnyar_2002 dominance, displacement, type of food sharing
	- (also under Sex) Dominant females scrounged from subordinate neighbors with whom they had a strong social affiliation (King_2009)


- Value of resources, strong/weak
    - @Broom_2014


- learning
- Learning
	- Early success may lead to individuals not adapting strategy to changing environments (Beauchamp_2000a)
	- Learning never evolves to fixation and at a stable equilibrium there is a mixture of fixed and learning players (Dubois_2010)
	- Social learning is favored when competition is weak (Smolla_2015)
	- If competition is strong, social learning is favored when resource quality is highly variable and there is low environmental turnover (Smolla_2015)
    - empirical
        - As individuals have more experience in variable environments, they increase proportion of scrounging (Afshar_2015)
        - Individuals that learned the task faster were less likely to scrounger (Aplin_2017)
	



    

Body size, foraging efficiency
    Payoffs were higher for producers in all environmental conditions, likely due to body size and foraging efficiency (Hansen_2016)
