title: "Box 2: Habitat Selection"
---


Habitat selection analyses seek to identify preferential use of habitats by animals to determine species distributions, derive inference on selection, or predict distributions in new spatial or temporal habitats. A habitat is defined as a set of environmental covariates categorized as resources, risks and conditions [@Aarts_2008; @Beyer_2010; @Matthiopoulos_2023]. Resources are assumed to have a positive relationship with fitness, for example forage patches or resting sites. Risks are assumed to have a negative relationships with fitness, for example predation or disturbance. Conditions are assumed to have relationship following a Gaussian function where average conditions are neutral and extreme conditions are negative, such as snow cover or temperature. While @Matthiopoulos_2023 suggest a species agnostic perspective, @Northrup_2022 argue that while maximal flexibility of the resultant model is lost, the species-agnostic criteria breaks previous definitions of habitat. 


There are a number of confounds that cloud the relationship between habitat use and selection. Two-way and three-way interactions between resources, risks, and conditions are common and can add further complicate analyses and their implications for habitat selection. For example, regions of high resource abundance may also have high predation risk leading to neutral or negative selection [@Matthiopoulos_2023]. Habitats are dynamic where, for example, seasonal differences in resources, extreme weather events, or sudden anthropogenic disturbance may cause changes in selection [@Matthiopoulos_2023]. Extinction debts and colonization credits [@Watts_2020] refer to the temporal lag of suitability that delays the disappearance or arrival of species. Site fidelity can contribute to animals returning to specific habitats irrespective of relative suitability of other habitats [@Matthiopoulos_2005]. Landscapes of fear, an animal's perception of spatial variation in predation risk [@Brown_2004; @Gaynor_2019], can contribute to avoidance of habitats disproportionate with the risks.

Conclusion/discussion

conditional nature of preference


while AIC is often recommended for evaluating alternative models [@Thurfjell_2014], model selection via AIC should only be used when the goal is to determine the most predictive model and not in cases where the model is used to provide inference about covariates causally influencing use and selection Stat rethink. adding more variables, and adding confounding variables can improve predictive performance and so selecting models for inference should be based on an understanding of the causal structure and not predictive performance of models
