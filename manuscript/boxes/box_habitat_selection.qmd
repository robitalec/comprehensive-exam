title: "Box 2: Habitat Selection"

Habitat selection analyses seek to identify preferential use of habitats by animals to determine species distributions, derive inference on selection, or predict distributions in new spatial or temporal habitats. A habitat is defined as a set of environmental covariates categorized as resources, risks and conditions [@Aarts_2008; @Beyer_2010; @Matthiopoulos_2023]. Resources are assumed to have a positive relationship with fitness, for example forage patches or resting sites. Risks are assumed to have a negative relationships with fitness, for example predation or disturbance. Conditions are assumed to have relationship following a Gaussian function where average conditions are neutral and extreme conditions are negative, such as snow cover or temperature. While @Matthiopoulos_2023 suggest a species agnostic perspective, @Northrup_2022 argue that while maximal flexibility of the resultant model is lost, the species-agnostic criteria breaks previous definitions of habitat. 

Preference for a habitat is defined as its disproportionate use conditional on its availability [@Aarts_2008; @Beyer_2010; @Northrup_2022]. 


There are a number of confounds that cloud the relationship between habitat use and selection. Two-way and three-way interactions between resources, risks, and conditions are common and can add further complicate analyses and their implications for habitat selection. For example, regions of high resource abundance may also have high predation risk leading to neutral or negative selection [@Matthiopoulos_2023]. Habitats are dynamic where, for example, seasonal differences in resources, extreme weather events, or sudden anthropogenic disturbance may cause changes in selection [@Matthiopoulos_2023]. Extinction debts and colonization credits [@Watts_2020] refer to the temporal lag of suitability that delays the disappearance or arrival of species. Site fidelity can contribute to animals returning to specific habitats irrespective of relative suitability of other habitats [@Matthiopoulos_2005]. Landscapes of fear, an animal's perception of spatial variation in predation risk [@Brown_2004; @Gaynor_2019], can contribute to avoidance of habitats disproportionate with the risks.
