- Examples of resources, risks and conditions from Matthiopolous 2023
- Examples of resources, risks and conditions from habitat selection literature


dynamic mechanisms influencing the relationship between fitness and species distribution

- demographic sorting at the population level
- habitat selection at the individuall level (behavioural selection)
    - voluntary movement composed of 
        - patch departure rules or giving up rates
            - marginal value theorem
            - intake rate
            - learning
            - information
            - environmental predictability
        - decision where to go
            - sensory perception
            - spatial memory
            - conspecific information
