title: "Box 2: Habitat Selection"
---


- Habitat selection, use /  available
- Habitat as environmental variables (resources, risks, conditions)
- Relationships between fitness and resources, risks and conditions (graphs)
- Examples of resources, risks and conditions from Matthiopolous 2023
- Examples of resources, risks and conditions from habitat selection literature


dynamic mechanisms influencing the relationship between fitness and species distribution

- demographic sorting at the population level
- habitat selection at the individuall level (behavioural selection)
    - voluntary movement composed of 
        - patch departure rules or giving up rates
            - marginal value theorem
            - intake rate
            - learning
            - information
            - environmental predictability
        - decision where to go
            - sensory perception
            - spatial memory
            - conspecific information

   

Mayor multiscale selection


conditional nature of preference


while AIC is often recommended for evaluating alternative models [@Thurfjell_2014], model selection via AIC should only be used when the goal is to determine the most predictive model and not in cases where the model is used to provide inference about covariates causally influencing use and selection Stat rethink. adding more variables, and adding confounding variables can improve predictive performance and so selecting models for inference should be based on an understanding of the causal structure and not predictive performance of models
