### Models

- Strategies
	- Producers, scroungers
	- Retaliators where finder can retaliate if joiner escalates (Dubois_2007)



- Finder's share
	- Increase finder's share leads to a decrease in proportion of scroungers (Barta_1998) (Lee_2016)
	- Finder's share allows producers to always aggressively defend clumps (Dubois_2005)
	- (also under Patch departure) A producer should leave a patch earlier than a scrounger if the producer has a finder's share (Rita_1997)
	
- Contests
	- Differences between individuals in valuing resources leads to fights mainly occuring between strong individuals or weak individuals (Broom_2014)
	- Convex cost functions correspond to risk of injury or lost energy and concave cost functions correspond to time costs eg exposure of predation risk (Broom_2015)
	- (also under Finder's share) Producers should always defend clumps given their advantage already having the finder's share (Dubois_2005)
	- (also under Patch density) Where patches are dense, scrounging is disfavored because of the time invested in contests (Dubois_2005)


- Aggression
	- Rate of aggression increases with group size (Caraco_1979)
	- Aggression should decrease as the density and richness of food clumps increases (Dubois_2003)
	- Costs of aggression increase with increasing predation pressure and so the rate of aggression should decrease (Dubois_2005)


- Predation
	- (also under Aggression) Costs of aggression increase with increasing predation pressure and so the rate of aggression should decrease (Dubois_2005)
	- Lower predation risk should lead to a decrease in scrounging (Dubois_2020)
	- (also under Vigilance) Scroungers may provide antipredator vigilance and contribute to dilution effect (Ranta_1996) (Ranta_1998)


- Sharing
	- Some animals share food clumps without any overt aggression possibly due to iterated play among familiar players (Dubois_2003)
	- When retaliator strategy is included, there is widespread sharing predicted in habitats clumped with intermediate richness (Dubois_2007)
	- When information asymmetry between producers and scroungers is incorporated, conditions for sharing are more easily met (Dubois_2007)
	- Sharing should be more common when resource heterogeneity leads to increased scrounger uncertainty (Dubois_2007)


- Vigilance 
	- Increased group size leads to decreased average vigilance (Caraco_1979)
	- Scroungers may provide antipredator vigilance and contribute to dilution effect (Ranta_1996) (Ranta_1998)


- Joining distance
	- Joining distance should increase with decreasing density of foragers, increasing speed of movement, increasing difficulty in finding undiscovered food patches and decreasing speed at which patches are consumed (Ruxton_2005)


- Depletability
	- Discovered patches are more heavily exploited when patches are hard to find (Ruxton_2005)


- Dominance
	- Similar dominance, individuals should similarly play scrounger (Barta_1998)
	- Asymmetrical dominance, dominant individuals should play scrounger more often (Barta_1998)
	- Dominance increases foraging efficiency and access to forage (Caraco_1979)
	- Dominant individuals prefer social foraging while subordinate individuals prefer solitary foraging (Caraco_1989) (Lee_2016)
	- Scrounging can be an exclusive strategy of dominant individuals depending on resource monopolizability (Lee_2016)
	- If patches are distributed in clumps, dominant individuals will be able to exploit most patches by following subordinates (Caraco_1989)
	
	
- Time of day
	- Around dawn and dusk, individuals should play scrounger more often due to low energy reserves (Barta_2000)
	- Around midday, individuals should play producer if they are near or above critical reserve level because if they are successful they can more quickly switch to resting and avoid predation hazard (Barta_2000)
	
	
- Interference
	- Interference between individuals reduces average intake rate and increases variation in intake rate across foragers (Beauchamp_1997)
	
	
- Group size
	- At larger group sizes, scrounging should be more likely and when there are few foragers, scrounging should be rare (Beauchamp_2000a) (Dubois_2005)
	- (also under Patch finding rate) When probability of finding patches decreases with increasing group size, number of scroungers should increase (Dubois_2020)
	- (also under Patch finding rate) When probability of finding patches increases with increasing group size, number of scroungers should decrease (Dubois_2020)

	
- Patch richness
	- In habitats with poorer patches, scrounging should be less likely (Beauchamp_2000a)
	- Increasing patch richness will increase scrounger's share and the proportion of scroungers will increase (Dubois_2005)
	- (also under Sharing) When retaliator strategy is included, there is widespread sharing predicted in habitats clumped with intermediate richness (Dubois_2007)
	- (also under Patch distribution) If patches are distributed in rich, clumps, scrounging should increase (Dubois_2020)
	
	
- Patch density
	- At higher patch densities, the producer's patch finding rate should increase (Dubois_2005)
	- At higher patch densities, the rate of scrounging should decrease as the temporal costs of contests makes scrounging less profitable (Dubois_2005)


- Patch distribution
	- (also under Dominance) If patches are distributed in clumps, dominant individuals will be able to exploit most patches by following subordinates (Caraco_1989)
	- If patches are distributed in rich, clumps, scrounging should increase and if patches are evenly distributed, producing should increase (Dubois_2020) (Ohtsuka_2009) 
	

- Patch finding rate
	- (also under Patch density)  At higher patch densities, the producer's patch finding rate should decrease (Dubois_2005)
	- When probability of finding patches decreases with increasing group size, number of scroungers should increase (Dubois_2020)
	- When probability of finding patches increases with increasing group size, number of scroungers should decrease (Dubois_2020)
	- Decreased patch finding rate reduces the costs of solitary foraging and scrounging is less common (Lee_2016)
	- Patch finding rate strongly influences frequency of producers (Ohtsuka_2009)
	- Patch finding rate increases with the number of producers (Rita_1997)
	
	
- Patch departure
	- A producer should leave a patch earlier than a scrounger if the producer has a finder's share (Rita_1997)
	
- Resource monopolizabilitu
 	- Easily monopolized resources

- Producer scrounger models
	- Producer priority where scrounging reduces producer's food intake but does not depend on the number of scroungers in the group (Caraco_1991)
	- Scramble competition where producer's food intake decreases with the number of scroungers (Caraco_1991)


- Learning
	- Early success may lead to individuals not adapting strategy to changing environments (Beauchamp_2000a)
	- Learning never evolves to fixation and at a stable equilibrium there is a mixture of fixed and learning players (Dubois_2010)
	- Social learning is favored when competition is weak (Smolla_2015)
	- If competition is strong, social learning is favored when resource quality is highly variable and there is low environmental turnover (Smolla_2015)

	
- Information
	- Extra information held by producers can be both beneficial and harmful (Broom_2016). 
	- Information not available to scrounger in situations where resources are not immediately visible eg. concelead nests, or where contest occurs quickly after patch is discovered and before producer has time to evaluate it (Broom_2016)
	- Producers should fight for resources when costs of contests are high or scrounger has a small change of winning the contest eg. if patch is easily defended (Broom_2016)
	- When scrounger's potential cost is small compared to the value of the patch or if the scrounger has a high change of winning, the scrounger should always fight (Broom_2016)


- Relatedness
	- Increased relatedness can lead producers to being more tolerant of scrounging relatives (Mathot_2010)


- Population
	- Scrounging can act as a population regulator by reducing population level foraging efficiency and intake rate and allowing larger population sizes of predators (Coolen_2007)
	- Social foraging can stabilize one prey and two prey systems when scrounging is prevalent in predators (Toyokawa_2017) (Vickery_2020)
	- Scrounging can lower the growth rate of a population (Toyokawa_2017)
	- Scrounging can allow prey resources to persist at higher densities than if scrounging was absent (Toyokawa_2017) (Vickery_2020)
	- Presence of scroungers in a predator can reduce the total amount of resource acquired by the group (Vickery_2020)
	- Presence of scroungers in a predator can limit group size (Vickery_2020)
	- Presence of scroungers in a predator can limit a predator's ability to outcompete other species promoting stability and species diversity (Vickery_2020)
	- Scrounging will not stability population dynamics, food chains and competitor interactions under all cases, if scrounging is too prevalent it can push the population to extinction  	- Other factors such as food abundance, variations in weather, predators and parasites may have stronger effects that can completely obscure the effects of scrounging on populations (Vickery_2020)

	- Scrounging was more common further from cover than close to it (Barta_2004)
	- Scrounging more common when interspecific competition for food with high predation risk individual (wolf) versus boar (Bugnyar_2002)
	- Wing load manipulation (by clipping primary flight feathers) as a proxy for perception of vulnerability to predation increased time vigilant (Mathot_2007)
	- Wing load manipulation as proxy for vulnerability to predation increased scrounging but cannot distinguish compatibility of scrounging and antipredator vigilance, or scrounging due to spatial position within a group (Mathot_2007)


- Vigilance
	- Scrounging not simply explained by antipredator vigilance, alternatively may be due to scrounging being a variance-averse strategy or favored strategy when energy reserves are low  (Barta_2004)
	- No compatibility between scrounging and antipredator vigilance (Coolen_2003)
	- (also under Predation risk) Wing load manipulation (by clipping primary flight feathers) as a proxy for perception of vulnerability to predation increased time vigilant (Mathot_2007)
	- (also under Predation risk) Wing load manipulation as proxy for vulnerability to predation increased scrounging but cannot distinguish compatibility of scrounging and antipredator vigilance, or scrounging due to spatial position within a group (Mathot_2007)


- Resource availability
	- At low and intermediate resource availability, scrounging is not favored after a 30s finder's share (Kok_2017)
	- At high resource availability, scrounging is favored up to 120s (Kok_2017)

- Finder's share
	- (also under Resource availability) At low and intermediate resource availability, scrounging is not favored after a 30s finder's share (Kok_2017)

	- (also under Dominance) Finder's share increased with dominance (Teichroeb_2015)
	- Finder's share decreased with increasing patch richness (Teichroeb_2015)
	
- Handling time
	- Prey size and longer handling time resulted in higher likelihood of conspecific stealing (Ha_2003)

- Environmental factors
	- (also under Sex) Air temperature, time of day, season (breeding vs nonbreeding), age or sex did not influence the probability of retaining prey (Ha_2003)
	- Wind exposure as a proxy to manipulate overnight energy expenditure lead dominants to scrounge more often and subordinates only marginally increase scrounging (Lendvai_2004)
	

- Energy reserves / fed or fasted
	- Rates of strategy use did not differ depending on fed and fasted states in sparrows (Lee_2016a)
	- Fasted sparrows stayed longer on the ground (Lee_2016a)
	- Fasted sparrows discovered more patches and consumed more food than fed sparrows (Lee_2016a)
	- (also under Vigilance) Scrounging not simply explained by antipredator vigilance, alternatively may be due to scrounging being a variance-averse strategy or favored strategy when energy reserves are low (Barta_2004)

- Spatial position
	- Scroungers more commonly found towards center of group, producers towards edges of group (Flynn_2001) (King_2009)
	- Groups with more scroungers tended to be more compact and densely grouped (Flynn_2001)
	- Patch finding rate increased for individuals at the front edge of the group (Hirsch_2019)
	- Foraging success was higher for individuals at the back of the group where fewer conspecifics joined (Hirsch_2019)


- Relatedness
	- Related finches had higher frequencies of scrounging than unrelated finches (Mathot_2010)


- Learning
	- As individuals have more experience in variable environments, they increase proportion of scrounging (Afshar_2015)
	- Individuals that learned the task faster were less likely to scrounger (Aplin_2017)
	
- Group size
	- Larger groups had a higher proportion of scroungers (Alfaro_2021) (Aplin_2017) (Barta_2004) (Coolen_2002)
	- (also under Finder's share) Finder's share decreased with forager density (Hirsch_2019)
	- At larger group sizes, energy intake and probability of obtaining a fish declined (Belisle_1998)
	
- Resource depletability
	- Larger groups required less time to deplete resources (Alfaro_2021)
	
- Patch finding rates
	- More scroungers resulted in a lower patch finding rate for the group (Coolen_2002)
	- (also under Spatial position) Patch finding rate increased for individuals at the front edge of the group (Hirsch_2019)

- Patch size
	- If patches are large, scrounging should be more frequent (Hansen_2016) (King_2009)
	- If patches are small, solitary foraging should be more frequent (Hansen_2016)
	
- Patch richness
	- (also under Finder's share) Finder's share decreased with increasing patch richness (Teichroeb_2015)
	
- Variance strategies
	- Variance-averse foragers prefer scrounging as it is less sensitive to patch quality variance (Afshar_2015)
	- (also under Vigilance) Scrounging not simply explained by antipredator vigilance, alternatively may be due to scrounging being a variance-averse strategy or favored strategy when energy reserves are low (Barta_2004)

- Arrival time on patch
	- Individuals that arrived earlier on the patch were less likely to scrounge (Aplin_2017)
	- 

- Payoffs
	- Payoffs were higher for producers in all environmental conditions, likely due to body size and foraging efficiency (Hansen_2016)


- Group formation
	- By being attracted to producers, scroungers induce group formation (Belisle_1998)
