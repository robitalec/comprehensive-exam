Social foraging theory examines how animal foraging behaviour is influenced by conspecifics. Individuals may choose to "produce" by independently searching for resources. Alternatively, individuals may choose to "scrounge" by following conspecifics to share or steal resources discovered by others. The dynamics of producer-scrounger behaviours are often studied using evolutionary game theory models to determine optimal strategies for maximizing individuals resource intake. Habitats, however, are more complex than patches of resources for individuals to share or steal from each other. Risks like predation or disturbance may force an individual to avoid certain areas. Conditions like temperature or snow cover may reduce an individual's ability to forage. Together, habitat risks,conditions, and the presence of conspecifics can influence the accessibility of resources.  I reviewed the producer-scrounger literature to determine how access to available resources depends on foraging roles, and how risks and conditions influence behaviours. While I found few examples where risks and conditions were tested in producer-scrounger dynamics, there were many examples of constraints on individuals, such as dominance or social affiliation, influencing foraging strategies. I propose that future work establishing the influence of risks and conditions on foraging strategies must also consider the potentially confounding individual constraints. Finally, I propose an extension to the habitat selection concept of availability to incorporate role in producer-scrounger dynamics.
