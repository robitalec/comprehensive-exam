The primary goals of this manuscript are to:

1.  Determine how foraging strategies are influenced by risks and conditions
2.  Determine how access to available resources is driven by foraging strategies
3.  Consider how the concept of availability during habitat selection can be extended to include foraging strategies

The @Matthiopoulos_2023 definition parses habitat into environmental variables categorized as resources, risks and conditions. The producer-scrounger literature reviewed (Table S1) has overwhelmingly focused on variables related to resources (Table 1). Some studies have examined risk explicitly, though mainly by using proxies for perception of predation risk in controlled environments [@Barta_2004; @Mathot_2007; but see @Bugnyar_2002]. Only one study considered conditions, though it is deemed here an example of kleptoparasitism rather than producer-scrounger dynamics because food items were indivisible [@Ha_2003, see details in Conditions below]. The reviewed literature has, however, explored many constraints on individuals beyond resources, risks and conditions that shape foraging strategy use including dominance hierarchies [@Caraco_1989; @Werdenich_2002; @King_2009; @Lee_2016], energy reserves [@Lendvai_2004; @Lee_2016a] and learning [@Afshar_2015; @Aplin_2017].


## Access depending on foraging strategy



## Influence of risks on foraging strategy

Risks of an animal's habitat are often implied in producer-scrounger models but rarely explicitly evaluated. @Barnard_1981 only consider the risks of conspecifics increasing competition or interference in foraging in their foundational work on producer-scrounger dynamics. @Giraldeau_2000 emphasize that social foraging theory is not the study of how foraging groups have evolved, for example in response to predation pressure. Rather, the focus is on the economic interdependence of individual foraging decisions where related payoffs and penalties such as predation risk can be incorporated. In the reviewed literature (Table S1), only seven studies explicitly considered the influence of predation risk (Table 1; 8.4 % relevant studies) and one study considered risks associated with fighting costs (Table 1; 1.2 % relevant studies) on foraging strategy use. 

@Dubois_2005 posit that predation risk should only affect foraging strategy use if one of the foraging strategies is disproportionately exposed to predator risk. We might expect that animals are more vulnerable to predation if they are searching for forage patches than if they are monitoring conspecifics for opportunities to scrounge. If scrounging behaviour offers the foraging group the benefit of increased vigilance, it could also be an explanation for the producers' tolerance of scroungers [@Ranta_1996; @Ranta_1998]. The relationship between scrounging and antipredator vigilance, however, is contested. 

@Mathot_2007 simulated predation risk using wing-loading manipulations on zebra finches (*Taeniopygia guttata*) and measured the time allocated to vigilance. Despite an increase in scrounging behaviour at higher predation risks, they could not separate the contribution of antipredator vigilance, spatial position in the group and head orientation (head up vigilant or head down foraging) on proportion of time scrounging. @Barta_2004 tested whether distance from cover as a proxy for predation risk increased use of scrounging behaviour in tree sparrows (*Passer montanus*). While scrounging behaviour was more common further from cover, it did not correspond to an increase in time vigilant. Finally, @Coolen_2003 found no evidence of compatibility between scrounger behaviour and antipredator vigilance in an experimental manipulation of predation risk in spice finches (*Lonchura punctulata*). 

@Bugnyar_2002 evaluated the proportion of scrounging behaviour depending on predation risk using a multispecies system of ravens (*Corvus corax*) scavenging either among wolves (*Canis lupus*) or among wild boars (*Sus scrofa*). Wolves would aggressively defend their food and potentially kill ravens, while wild boars would not. Foraging behaviour was categorized as producing when ravens attempted to obtain food directly from wolves or wild boars and categorized as scrounging when ravens attempted to obtain food from conspecifics. The proportion of scrounging was higher in ravens scavenging among wolves than among wild boars. 

@Broom_2015 explicitly considered the relationship between foraging strategy and cost of contests on access to forage using an evolutionary game theory model of producer-scrounger dynamics. Instead of a binary determination for engaging in a contest, individuals could invest effort along a particular cost function. Two cost functions were described: convex cost functions where intial costs were small but quickly grew larger, and concave cost functions where initial costs are high but continued investment is comparitively small. Convex cost functions correspond to major costs such as risk of injury, and concave cost functions correspond to time costs such as exposure of predation risk. @Broom_2015 predicted that at high levels of maximum investment, scroungers should obtain resources at some cost for convex functions while producers should obtain resources without contest for concave functions. 

Risks  not considered in the reviewed producer-scrounger literature (Table S1) include, for example, parasites, diseases, insect harassment, wildfires, drought, and anthropogenic harvest or disturbance (Table 1). 


## Influence of conditions on foraging strategy
1.  while risks and resources related respectively to patch payoffs and penalties the relationship between habitat conditions and foraging strategy is less clear.
    -   @Ha_2003 , except it was an indivisible food item therefore results more closely related to kleptoparasitism and either way they found no relationship with temperature
2.  Taking the logic from @Dubois_2005, consider which conditions may affect one of the two foraging strategies disproportionately.
    - Joining decision
        - movement speedd, difficulty findingg undiscovered food patches
        - Increased snow depth could increase movement cost for a scrounger to join a producer's patch.



## Resources considered in producer-scrounger dynamics






## Contrasting approaches to availability of resources 

-   Habitat availability
    -   Geographical accessibility

Contrasting approaches to availability
The ps literature has mostly assumed availability, often of all patches discovered by
a producer are immediately available to a scrounger.
Other times the availability is considered with more spatial criteria such as
spatial position in a group or time to
Movement time and cost are inherently built into the mathematical expression of
producer scrounger evo game theory models in the finder s share
Nevertheless, many assumptions disregard spatial realities of spatial relationships,
movement costs

Habitat selection theory explicitly considers what is available, compared to what
is used
The definition of availability has grown in development of concepts and ideas
as well as as computational approaches are more efficient and accessible

Treated simply, availability can be considered at a single scale or multiple scales
It can be on the basis of a population distribution, an animal's home range or the availability
of alternative destinations at each step

A future direction for the habitat selection literature would be to attempt to
reconcile where animal's roles directly influence their availability
WHile a producer may have an entire landscape available to them, a scrounger only has the
landscape uncovered by conspecifics available to them

Roles are not fixed and animals switch between them
Focal observations would help draw more relationships between habitat conditions and risks
and foraging strategy use
One analytical solution to the integration of foraging roles into availability during
habitat selection could be to consider an each animal's availability (assuming
a step selection approach) as composed of

1. the animal's distribution of available steps and turn angles
2. the distribution of steps that would allow the animal to scrounge from a nearest neighbour
or set of neighbors within a reasonable distance

This combination would assume that all individuals may opt to produce or to scrounge at
each step and that an animal stepping to a neighbour is assumed to be scrounging from it
