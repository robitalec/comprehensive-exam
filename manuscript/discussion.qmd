The objective was to answer the question: "How does one's role in frequency-dependent producer-scrounger dynamics influence access to available resources considering risks and conditions during habitat selection?". From this, I defined three goals: 1) to determine how foraging strategies differ in access to available resources, 2) to determine how risks and conditions influence foraging strategies and 3) to consider how the concept of availability during habitat selection can be extended to include foraging strategies. For 1) and 2), I identified empirical tests and model predictions in the literature that contribute to our understanding of access and the influence of habitat risks and conditions. For 3), I propose an extension of the concept of availability from the habitat selection literature to incorporate role in producer-scrounger dynamics. 

Recall the @Matthiopoulos_2023 definition of habitat as the collection of environmental variables categorized as resources, risks and conditions. The literature reviewed (Table S1) has overwhelmingly focused on the influence of resources on producer-scrounger dynamics (Table 1). Some studies have examined the influence of risks, though mainly by using proxies for perception of predation risk in controlled environments [@Barta_2004; @Mathot_2007; but see @Bugnyar_2002]. Only one study considered the influence of conditions, though it is deemed here an example of kleptoparasitism rather than producer-scrounger dynamics because food items were indivisible [@Ha_2003, see details in Conditions below]. 

The reviewed literature has, however, explored many constraints on individuals beyond resources, risks and conditions that shape foraging strategy use including dominance hierarchies [@Caraco_1989; @Werdenich_2002; @King_2009; @Lee_2016], energy reserves [@Lendvai_2004; @Lee_2016a] and learning [@Afshar_2015; @Aplin_2017] (Figure S1, Box 3).
@Dubois_2005 posited that predation risk should only affect foraging strategy use if one strategy is disproportionately exposed to predation risk. Extending this logic, I will detail how the variables uncovered in the literature influence access to available resources depending on foraging strategy use.

Foraging strategy influenced access to available resources through XYZ. 


Finder's share (See Box 1) is incorporated in evolutionary game theory models of producer-scrounger dynamics to represent the advantage of a producer being on the patch first, and to represent the movement time and costs for a scrounger to join them. Increasing the finder's share leads to a decrease in the proportion of scroungers [@Barta_1998; @Lee_2016]. However, the finder's share decreases with patch size [@Hansen_2016], forager density [@Hirsch_2019] and patch richness [@Teichroeb_2015; @Kok_2017]. For example, when patches had more food available to share, scrounger veld goats (*Capra hircus*) would decide to join even after a longer delay (representing a larger finder's share) compared to patches with lower food availability [@Kok_2017].

- Arrival time on patch
	- Individuals that arrived earlier on the patch were less likely to scrounge (Aplin_2017)

- Patch finding rate
	- (also under Patch density)  At higher patch densities, the producer's patch finding rate should decrease (Dubois_2005)
	- When probability of finding patches decreases with increasing group size, number of scroungers should increase (Dubois_2020)
	- When probability of finding patches increases with increasing group size, number of scroungers should decrease (Dubois_2020)
	- Decreased patch finding rate reduces the costs of solitary foraging and scrounging is less common (Lee_2016)
	- Patch finding rate strongly influences frequency of producers (Ohtsuka_2009)
	- Patch finding rate increases with the number of producers (Rita_1997)

	- More scroungers resulted in a lower patch finding rate for the group (Coolen_2002)
	- (also under Spatial position) Patch finding rate increased for individuals at the front edge of the group (Hirsch_2019)

- Resource monopolizabilitu
 	- Easily monopolized resources (CITE?)
    - Handling time
	    - Prey size and longer handling time resulted in higher likelihood of conspecific stealing (Ha_2003)

## Influence of risks on foraging strategy


Risks of an animal's habitat are often implied in producer-scrounger models but rarely explicitly evaluated. @Barnard_1981 only consider the risks of conspecifics increasing competition or interference in foraging in their foundational work on producer-scrounger dynamics. @Giraldeau_2000 emphasize that social foraging theory is not the study of how foraging groups have evolved, for example in response to predation pressure. Rather, the focus is on the economic interdependence of individual foraging decisions where related payoffs and penalties such as predation risk can be incorporated. In the reviewed literature (Table S1), only seven studies explicitly considered the influence of predation risk (Table 1; 8.4 % of relevant studies) and one study considered risks associated with fighting costs (Table 1; 1.2 % of relevant studies) on foraging strategy use. 

@Dubois_2005 posit that predation risk should only affect foraging strategy use if one of the foraging strategies is disproportionately exposed to predator risk. 


For example, we might expect that animals are more vulnerable to predation if they are searching for forage patches than if they are monitoring conspecifics for opportunities to scrounge. If scrounging behaviour offers the foraging group the benefit of increased vigilance, it could also be an explanation for the producers' tolerance of scroungers [@Ranta_1996; @Ranta_1998]. The relationship between scrounging and antipredator vigilance, however, is contested. 

@Mathot_2007 simulated predation risk using wing-loading manipulations on zebra finches (*Taeniopygia guttata*) and measured the time allocated to vigilance. Despite an increase in scrounging behaviour at higher predation risks, they could not separate the contribution of antipredator vigilance, spatial position in the group and head orientation (head up vigilant or head down foraging) on proportion of time scrounging. @Barta_2004 tested whether distance from cover as a proxy for predation risk increased use of scrounging behaviour in tree sparrows (*Passer montanus*). While scrounging behaviour was more common further from cover, it did not correspond to an increase in time vigilant. Finally, @Coolen_2003 found no evidence of compatibility between scrounger behaviour and antipredator vigilance in an experimental manipulation of predation risk in spice finches (*Lonchura punctulata*). 

@Bugnyar_2002 evaluated the proportion of scrounging behaviour depending on predation risk using a multispecies system of ravens (*Corvus corax*) scavenging either among wolves (*Canis lupus*) or among wild boars (*Sus scrofa*). Wolves would aggressively defend their food and potentially kill ravens, while wild boars would not. Foraging behaviour was categorized as producing when ravens attempted to obtain food directly from wolves or wild boars and categorized as scrounging when ravens attempted to obtain food from conspecifics. The proportion of scrounging was higher in ravens scavenging among wolves than among wild boars. 

@Broom_2015 explicitly considered the relationship between foraging strategy and cost of contests on access to forage using an evolutionary game theory model of producer-scrounger dynamics. Instead of a binary determination for engaging in a contest, individuals could invest effort along a particular cost function. Two cost functions were described: convex cost functions where intial costs were small but quickly grew larger, and concave cost functions where initial costs are high but continued investment is comparatively small. Convex cost functions correspond to major costs such as risk of injury, and concave cost functions correspond to time costs such as exposure to predation risk. @Broom_2015 predicted that at high levels of maximum investment, scroungers should obtain resources at some cost for convex functions while producers should obtain resources without contest for concave functions. 


<!-- 
Interactions between risks and resource quality or abundance have also been noted

Where patches are dense, scrounging is disfavored because of the time invested in contests (Dubois_2005) 

Aggression should decrease as the density and richness of food clumps increases (Dubois_2003)

Costs of aggression increase with increasing predation pressure and so the rate of aggression should decrease (Dubois_2005)

-->

Other types of risks are not considered in the reviewed producer-scrounger literature (Table S1) including, for example, parasites, diseases, insect harassment, wildfires, drought, and anthropogenic harvest or disturbance (Table 1). 




## Influence of conditions on foraging strategy
1.  while risks and resources related respectively to patch payoffs and penalties the relationship between habitat conditions and foraging strategy is less clear.
    -   @Ha_2003 , except it was an indivisible food item therefore results more closely related to kleptoparasitism and either way they found no relationship with temperature
2.  Taking the logic from @Dubois_2005, consider which conditions may affect one of the two foraging strategies disproportionately.
    - Joining decision
        - movement speedd, difficulty findingg undiscovered food patches
        - Increased snow depth could increase movement cost for a scrounger to join a producer's patch.
    - Vickery hypotheticall sensory connection


## Resources considered in producer-scrounger dynamics


<!--
- Patch richness
	- In habitats with poorer patches, scrounging should be less likely (Beauchamp_2000a)
	- Increasing patch richness will increase scrounger's share and the proportion of scroungers will increase (Dubois_2005)
	- (also under Sharing) When retaliator strategy is included, there is widespread sharing predicted in habitats clumped with intermediate richness (Dubois_2007)
	- (also under Patch distribution) If patches are distributed in rich, clumps, scrounging should increase (Dubois_2020)
    
- Patch density
	- At higher patch densities, the producer's patch finding rate should increase (Dubois_2005)
	- At higher patch densities, the rate of scrounging should decrease as the temporal costs of contests makes scrounging less profitable (Dubois_2005)


- Patch distribution
	- (also under Dominance) If patches are distributed in clumps, dominant individuals will be able to exploit most patches by following subordinates (Caraco_1989)
	- If patches are distributed in rich, clumps, scrounging should increase and if patches are evenly distributed, producing should increase (Dubois_2020) (Ohtsuka_2009) 

- Patch size
	- If patches are large, scrounging should be more frequent (Hansen_2016) (King_2009)
	- If patches are small, solitary foraging should be more frequent (Hansen_2016)

## Contrasting approaches to availability of resources 

-   Habitat availability
    -   Geographical accessibility
        -   @Matthiopoulos_2020


Contrasting approaches to availability
The ps literature has mostly assumed availability, often of all patches discovered by
a producer are immediately available to a scrounger.
Other times the availability is considered with more spatial criteria such as
spatial position in a group or time to
Movement time and cost are inherently built into the mathematical expression of
producer scrounger evo game theory models in the finder s share
Nevertheless, many assumptions disregard spatial realities of spatial relationships,
movement costs

Habitat selection theory explicitly considers what is available, compared to what
is used
The definition of availability has grown in development of concepts and ideas
as well as as computational approaches are more efficient and accessible

Treated simply, availability can be considered at a single scale or multiple scales
It can be on the basis of a population distribution, an animal's home range or the availability
of alternative destinations at each step

A future direction for the habitat selection literature would be to attempt to
reconcile where animal's roles directly influence their availability
WHile a producer may have an entire landscape available to them, a scrounger only has the
landscape uncovered by conspecifics available to them

Roles are not fixed and animals switch between them
Focal observations would help draw more relationships between habitat conditions and risks
and foraging strategy use
One analytical solution to the integration of foraging roles into availability during
habitat selection could be to consider an each animal's availability (assuming
a step selection approach) as composed of

1. the animal's distribution of available steps and turn angles
2. the distribution of steps that would allow the animal to scrounge from a nearest neighbour
or set of neighbors within a reasonable distance

This combination would assume that all individuals may opt to produce or to scrounge at
each step and that an animal stepping to a neighbour is assumed to be scrounging from it

	- Stable dimorphic distribution of producers and scroungers (Aplin_2017)
	- Individuals likely to use both strategies (Ha_2003)
