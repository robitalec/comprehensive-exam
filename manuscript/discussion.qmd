The producer-scrounger literature reviewed (Table S1) has overwhelmingly focused on variables related to resources and to constraints on individuals when foraging. Some studies

The producer-scrounger literature 

Benefits and costs of sociality

Giraldeau and Caraco highlight that social foraging theory is not the evolution of sociality

Producer-scrounger models have predation risk assumed, integrated in the payoffs and penalties. 

While conspecifics may provide predation dilution and contribute to antipredator vigilance, they may also reduce foraging efficiency and increase the rate of conflicts and aggression. These costs and benefits of sociality have been explored in the producer-scrounger literature where scrounging behaviour

## Conditions


If we adopt the logic from Dubois (2005), we can predict which conditions could influence producer-scrounger dynamics if the condition disproportionately affects one of the contrasting foraging behaviours. 

Increased snow depth could increase movement cost for a scrounger to join a producer's patch.
