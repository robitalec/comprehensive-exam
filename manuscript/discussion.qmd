The primary goals of this manuscript are to:

1. Determine how foraging strategies are influenced by risks and conditions
1. Determine how access to available resources is driven by foraging strategies
1. Consider how the concept of availability during habitat selection can be extended to include foraging strategies



The @Matthiopoulos_2023 definition parses habitat into environmental variables categorized as resources, risks and conditions. The producer-scrounger literature reviewed (Table S1) has overwhelmingly focused on variables related to resources (Table 1). Some studies have examined risk explicitly, though mainly by using proxies for perception of predation risk under controlled experiments [@Barta_2004; @Mathot_2007; but see @Bugnyar_2002]. Only one study considered conditions, though it is deemed here as an example of kleptoparasitism rather than producer-scrounger dynamics because food items were indivisible [@Ha_2003, see details in Conditions below]. The reviewed literature has, however, explored many constraints on individuals beyond resources, risks and conditions that shape foraging strategy use including dominance hierarchies [@Caraco_1989; @Werdenich_2002; @King_2009; @Lee_2016], energy reserves [@Lendvai_2004; @Lee_2016a] and learning [@Afshar_2015; @Aplin_2017]. 



## Risks

@Barnard_1981 considered only consider the risk of conspecifics increasing competition or interference in foraging. @Giraldeau_2000

    - Predation risk is assumed, implied 
1. @Dubois_2005 predation risk risk should not effect foraging tactic use unless one of the foraging tactics is  disproportionately exposed to predation than the other 
    - @Teichroeb_2015 spatial position
1. Where predation risk has been made explicit, producer-scrounger models have found XYZ
    1. Conflicts in the literature for the influence of predation risk on proportion of scroungers in a group
1. Considering the relationships of producers and scroungers in geographical space, we can expect additional constraints on the scrounging behaviour.

The producer-scrounger literature 

Benefits and costs of sociality

Giraldeau and Caraco highlight that social foraging theory is not the evolution of sociality

Producer-scrounger models have predation risk assumed, integrated in the payoffs and penalties. 

While conspecifics may provide predation dilution and contribute to antipredator vigilance, they may also reduce foraging efficiency and increase the rate of conflicts and aggression. These costs and benefits of sociality have been explored in the producer-scrounger literature where scrounging behaviour

## Conditions

1. while risks and resources related respectively to patch payoffs and penalties the relationship between habitat conditions and foraging strategy is less clear. 
    - @Ha_2003 , except it was an indivisible food item therefore results more closely related to kleptoparasitism and either way they found no relationship with temperature
1. Taking the logic from @Dubois_2005, consider which conditions may affect one of the two foraging strategies disproportionately.

        - 

Increased snow depth could increase movement cost for a scrounger to join a producer's patch.

## Resources




## Individual constraints

- Dominance
    - Dominance not as relevant for eg finches than baboons?


## Availability

- Habitat availability 
    - Geographical accessibility
