The objective was to answer the question: "How does one's role in frequency-dependent producer-scrounger dynamics influence access to available resources considering risks and conditions during habitat selection?". From this, I defined three goals: 1) to determine how foraging strategies differ in access to available resources, 2) to determine how risks and conditions influence foraging strategies and 3) to consider how the concept of availability during habitat selection can be extended to include foraging strategies. For 1) and 2), I identified empirical tests and model predictions in the literature that contribute to our understanding of access and the influence of habitat risks and conditions. For 3), I propose an extension of the concept of availability from the habitat selection literature to incorporate role in producer-scrounger dynamics. 

Recall the @Matthiopoulos_2023 definition of habitat as the collection of environmental variables categorized as resources, risks and conditions. The literature reviewed (Table S1) has overwhelmingly focused on the influence of resources on producer-scrounger dynamics, leaving the influence of risks and conditions largely ignored (Table 1). Of the studies that examined the influence of risks, they mainly did so using proxies for perception of predation risk in controlled environments [@Barta_2004; @Mathot_2007; but see @Bugnyar_2002]. Only one study considered the influence of conditions, though it is deemed here an example of kleptoparasitism rather than producer-scrounger dynamics because food items were indivisible [@Ha_2003, see details in Conditions below]. 

The reviewed literature has also explored many constraints on individuals beyond resources, risks and conditions that shape foraging strategy use and access to available resources including dominance [@Caraco_1989; @Werdenich_2002; @King_2009; @Lee_2016], energy reserves [@Lendvai_2004; @Lee_2016a] and learning [@Afshar_2015; @Aplin_2017] (Box 3). I will take the logic from @Dubois_2005 who posited that predation risk should only influence foraging strategy use if it disproportionately affects certain strategies. Extending this, I concentrate among all the potential variables (Figure S1) to focus on those affecting access and availability of resources differentially depending on role in producer-scrounger dynamics. For clarity and equivalence with Figures 2, 3, and S1, I will discuss only in terms of proportion of scrounging behaviour where negative influences on the proportion of scrounging are equivalent to positive influences on the proportion of producing.

## Influence of resources on foraging strategy


Access to resources differed between roles in producer-scrounger dynamics when the availability of resources favored one foraging strategy over the other. Producers have an initial period of solitary foraging before scroungers join them on the patch. This priority access, termed the finder's share, offers an advantage where producers can forage without interference before scroungers join the patch. Scroungers conversely had an advantage when the discovered patches were large or rich in resources, offering an abundance beyond the finder's share. 

In evolutionary game theory approaches (Table 1), the differences in access to available resources are incorporated directly in the payoffs and penalties of each foraging strategy (See Box 1). The finder's share represents both the benefit to a producer for being on the patch first, and also the cost to a scrounger for the effort in joining them, either as a temporal delay or a movement cost [@Giraldeau_2000]. As the finder's share increases, the proportion of scroungers in the group or population decreases [@Barta_1998; @Ohtsuka_2009; @Lee_2016]. The rate at which producers find patches, termed the patch discovery rate, also influences the proportion of scroungers. When patches are more easily discovered, the costs of producing decreases and, correspondingly, the proportion of scroungers decreases [@Dubois_2005; @Lee_2016]. In sum, if patches are easily found or if finder's share is large, the producer strategy is favored in the group. 

Large, rich or clumped patches lead to an increase in the proportion of scroungers. When patches are large and rich, the food items on the patch remaining after the finder's share, termed the scrounger's share, are larger. As the scrounger's share increases, so do the benefits to scroungers and the proportion of scrounging is expected to increase in the group or population [@Beauchamp_2000a; @Dubois_2005; @Dubois_2020]. The distribution of patches also influences the proportion of scrounging through the influence on patch discovery rate. When patches are scattered and clumped patches, patches less easily discovered and scrounging is favoured

- However, the finder's share decreases with patch size [@Hansen_2016], forager density [@Hirsch_2019] and patch richness [@Teichroeb_2015; @Kok_2017]. For example, when patches had more food available to share, scrounger veld goats (*Capra hircus*) would decide to join even after a longer delay (representing a larger finder's share) compared to patches with lower food availability [@Kok_2017].
- Individuals that arrived earlier on the patch were less likely to scrounge [@Aplin_2017]

- Patch size
	- If patches are large, scrounging should be more frequent (Hansen_2016) (King_2009)
	- If patches are small, solitary foraging should be more frequent (Hansen_2016)
	




## Influence of risks on foraging strategy


- Reviewed literature has N predation risk and N fighting cost
- Barnard Sibly consider competition or interference in their foundational work as part of the frequency dependence

In the reviewed literature (Table S1), only seven studies explicitly considered the influence of predation risk (Table 1; 8.4 % of relevant studies) and one study considered risks associated with fighting costs (Table 1; 1.2 % of relevant studies) on foraging strategy use. 


Risks of an animal's habitat are often implied in producer-scrounger models but rarely explicitly evaluated. @Barnard_1981 only consider the risks of conspecifics increasing competition or interference in foraging in their foundational work on producer-scrounger dynamics. @Giraldeau_2000 emphasize that social foraging theory is not the study of how foraging groups have evolved, for example in response to predation pressure. Rather, the focus is on the economic interdependence of individual foraging decisions where related payoffs and penalties such as predation risk can be incorporated. 


- Does one foraging strategy disproportionately increase predation risk?

For example, we might expect that animals are more vulnerable to predation if they are searching for forage patches than if they are monitoring conspecifics for opportunities to scrounge. If scrounging behaviour offers the foraging group the benefit of increased vigilance, it could also be an explanation for the producers' tolerance of scroungers [@Ranta_1996; @Ranta_1998]. The relationship between scrounging and antipredator vigilance, however, is contested. 

@Mathot_2007 simulated predation risk using wing-loading manipulations on zebra finches (*Taeniopygia guttata*) and measured the time allocated to vigilance. Despite an increase in scrounging behaviour at higher predation risks, they could not separate the contribution of antipredator vigilance, spatial position in the group and head orientation (head up vigilant or head down foraging) on proportion of time scrounging. @Barta_2004 tested whether distance from cover as a proxy for predation risk increased use of scrounging behaviour in tree sparrows (*Passer montanus*). While scrounging behaviour was more common further from cover, it did not correspond to an increase in time vigilant. Finally, @Coolen_2003 found no evidence of compatibility between scrounger behaviour and antipredator vigilance in an experimental manipulation of predation risk in spice finches (*Lonchura punctulata*). 

- If scrounging behaviour is not definitively related to antipredator vigilance, how does it differ from producing in terms of predation risk



@Bugnyar_2002 evaluated the proportion of scrounging behaviour depending on predation risk using a multispecies system of ravens (*Corvus corax*) scavenging either among wolves (*Canis lupus*) or among wild boars (*Sus scrofa*). Wolves would aggressively defend their food and potentially kill ravens, while wild boars would not. Foraging behaviour was categorized as producing when ravens attempted to obtain food directly from wolves or wild boars and categorized as scrounging when ravens attempted to obtain food from conspecifics. The proportion of scrounging was higher in ravens scavenging among wolves than among wild boars. 

- Interpret Bugnyar
	- specific definitions of producing/scrounging depending on the case
- Hypothetical
	- group size related to scrounging vs producing which can be solitary
	- dilution Ranta 


- Another risk of social foraging is competition with conspecifics, specifically contests for access to forage 

@Broom_2015 explicitly considered the relationship between foraging strategy and cost of contests on access to forage using an evolutionary game theory model of producer-scrounger dynamics. Instead of a binary determination for engaging in a contest, individuals could invest effort along a particular cost function. Two cost functions were described: convex cost functions where intial costs were small but quickly grew larger, and concave cost functions where initial costs are high but continued investment is comparatively small. Convex cost functions correspond to major costs such as risk of injury, and concave cost functions correspond to time costs such as exposure to predation risk. @Broom_2015 predicted that at high levels of maximum investment, scroungers should obtain resources at some cost for convex functions while producers should obtain resources without contest for concave functions. 

- Interpret



- More complex interactions of variables (excluded from Figure S1) include
	- When overall availability of resources is high, and scrounging behaviour reduces access because of its time investment
		- Where patches are dense, scrounging is disfavored because of the time invested in contests (Dubois_2005). 
	- But see Dubois 2003, where density, richness of food clumps increases, aggression should decrease
	- Aggression depending on predation risk
		- Costs of aggression increase with increasing predation pressure and so the rate of aggression should decrease (Dubois_2005)
- Other types of risks are not considered
	- Other types of risks are not considered in the reviewed producer-scrounger literature (Table S1) including, for example, parasites, diseases, insect harassment, wildfires, drought, and anthropogenic harvest or disturbance (Table 1). 




## Influence of conditions on foraging strategy

- relationship between risks and resources to patch payoffs and penalties respectively
- @Matthiopoulos_2023 describe conditions as having a bell shaped relationship with fitness (double check) where outside the typical or reasonable range, individuals had decreased fitness
- for producer scrounger dynamics, and taking dubois 2005's logic this means we are expecting variables to have a disproportionate influence on one foraging strategy outside of the regular or average conditions

- @Ha_2003 found no relationship
	- except it was an indivisible food item therefore results more closely related to kleptoparasitism and either way they found no relationship with temperature

- Consider producing and Table 1
	- difficulty finding undiscovered patches


- Consider joining distance @Ruxton_2005 and Table 1
	- movement speed
	- Increased snow depth for example could increase movement cost for a scrounger to join a producer's patch.

## Contrasting approaches to availability of resources 

-   Habitat availability
    -   Geographical accessibility
        -   @Matthiopoulos_2020


Contrasting approaches to availability
The ps literature has mostly assumed availability, often of all patches discovered by
a producer are immediately available to a scrounger.
Other times the availability is considered with more spatial criteria such as
spatial position in a group or time to
Movement time and cost are inherently built into the mathematical expression of
producer scrounger evo game theory models in the finder s share
Nevertheless, many assumptions disregard spatial realities of spatial relationships,
movement costs

Habitat selection theory explicitly considers what is available, compared to what
is used
The definition of availability has grown in development of concepts and ideas
as well as as computational approaches are more efficient and accessible

Treated simply, availability can be considered at a single scale or multiple scales
It can be on the basis of a population distribution, an animal's home range or the availability
of alternative destinations at each step

A future direction for the habitat selection literature would be to attempt to
reconcile where animal's roles directly influence their availability
WHile a producer may have an entire landscape available to them, a scrounger only has the
landscape uncovered by conspecifics available to them

Roles are not fixed and animals switch between them
Focal observations would help draw more relationships between habitat conditions and risks
and foraging strategy use
One analytical solution to the integration of foraging roles into availability during
habitat selection could be to consider an each animal's availability (assuming
a step selection approach) as composed of

1. the animal's distribution of available steps and turn angles
2. the distribution of steps that would allow the animal to scrounge from a nearest neighbour
or set of neighbors within a reasonable distance

This combination would assume that all individuals may opt to produce or to scrounge at
each step and that an animal stepping to a neighbour is assumed to be scrounging from it
