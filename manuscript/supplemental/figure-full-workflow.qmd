Figure S1: Graph visualization of all variables directly and indirectly related to producer-scrounger dynamics identified in the reviewed literature (Table S1). The color of the lines indicates the nature of the relationship: blue indicates a positive relationship, red indicates a negative relationship, black indicates a neutral relationship, orange indicates a convex relationship and grey indicates subcategories. For example, dominance has a positive relationship on forage access [@Caraco_1979], patch richness has a negative relationship with rate of aggression [@Dubois_2003], proportion of scroungers has a neutral relationship with antipredator vigilance [@Mathot_2007], time of day has a convex relationship with proportion of scroungers [@Barta_2000], and juveniles and adults are subcategories of age. Linetypes indicate the approach of the study that contributed this relationship where solid lines are producer-scrounger models using evolutionary game theory and dashed lines are empirical tests. For example, the relationship between patch richness and rate of aggression was contributed by an evolutionary game theory model [@Dubois_2003] and the relationship between proportion of scroungers and antipredator vigilance was contributed by an empirical test [@Mathot_2007]. Note that multiple lines may be drawn between the same pair of variables and when they are differently colored it indicates a disagreement in the reviewed articles. Citations for multiple articles that contributed the same approach (linetype) and nature of relationship (color) are combined in a list. Citations are always found above the line between the two variables. The graph visualization was built using GraphViz [@Gansner_2000].
