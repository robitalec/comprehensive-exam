Foraging for resources depends on the behaviour of conspecifics. Early individual foraging theory often focused on forage selection, net rate of intake, and effort or quitting time [@Stephens_1986; @Stephens_2007]. Social foraging theory considers the interdependence between a forager's strategy and that of their conspecifics [@Giraldeau_2000, Box 1]. The complexity of multiple individuals foraging from a common patch requires attention to both the density of individuals and the frequency of strategies among them [@Barnard_1981; @Vickery_1991; @Giraldeau_2000]. Social foraging theory considers a minimum criterion for sociality where animals are considered social if their benefits and costs are interdependent [@Giraldeau_2000]. Producer-scrounger dynamics are a type of social foraging model that considers two types of foraging behaviours [@Barnard_1981; @Giraldeau_2000; but see @Vickery_1991]. Producers are animals that independently search for forage patches. Scroungers follow conspecific producers to share or steal from their discovered patches. The frequency of each strategy in a group or population changes its profitability. When producers are rare, scrounging is less favorable since less patches are being discovered. When scroungers are common, producers have to divide their patches among more conspecifics [@Vickery_1991; @Giraldeau_2000; @Dubois_2005]. Notably, the accessibility of resources is different depending on the foraging strategy where scroungers only have access to patches made available to them by producers. 

Determining the subset of available habitat that is accessible to animals has been a methodological focus in estimating habitat selection [@Beyer_2010; @Northrup_2013; @Matthiopoulos_2020]. Part of this focus is due to the inherent requirement for a definition of availability to calculation selection. Preferential selection of a habitat by an animal is defined as the disproportionate use given the availability. If the measurement of available habitat is inaccurate, the measure of selection will be inaccurate [@Beyer_2010]. Advances in theory and computational power have offered a refined measure of availability that is constrained to variables related to animal's movement patterns [@Thurfjell_2014]. Given these, habitat selection analyses help discern the relationship between animal's movement and their selection or avoidance for particular habitats [@Matthiopoulos_2023, Box 2]. 

A habitat is defined as a combination of environmental variables categorized as resources, risks and conditions [@Aarts_2008; @Matthiopoulos_2023, Box 2]. Resources are variables that provide a benefit to an animal including forage, mating opportunities, resting sites, and nesting sites. Risks are variables that can have a negative influence on survival or contribute to perceived risk including predation, anthropogenic disturbance or harvest, and parasites. Conditions are variables that often have negative effects when they are extreme but neutral effects at average levels including temperature, humidity, salinity, and wind speed. Resources, risks and conditions influence species distributions and individual behavioural selection of habitats [@Matthiopoulos_2023]. <!-- tie into behaviour influence -->

The goals of this manuscript are to address the following: 1) how is access to available resources related dependent on role in producer-scrounger dynamics?, 2) how are foraging strategies influenced by resources, risks and conditions, and 3) how can the concept of availability during habitat selection be extended by consider producer-scrounger dynamics? To address these, I will review the producer-scrounger dynamics literature (see details in Supplement: Methods) to identify variables influencing access and availability of resources, and tests of the influence of risks and conditions on foraging strategy use. Finally, I will bridge the social foraging theory into habitat selection analyses by proposing a novel integration of availability using foraging strategy (Figure 1).  


<!-- 

- Habitats are defined as a collection of environmental variables categorized as resources, risks and conditions. 
- Accessibility and availability are impossible to calculate is alternatively defined in habitat selection

---

- Habitat selection offers species distributions, model inference or predictions about habitat selection
    - Behavioural selection for habitat is based in the decision when to leave a patch and where to go next @Matthiopoulos_2023
    - Animal sociality is often described as a balance between advantages and disadvantages. Social foraging theory is not centred on competing causes of sociality. Rather the payoffs and penalties are directly integrated as currencies of fitness. 
- 1. How is access to available resources determined by role?
- Conspecifics influence but so does habitat
    - Habitat = resources, risks, conditions
        - habitats under this definition allow for multiple scales of selection
    - Species-habitat associations are used to understand the relationship between
species distribution and habitats (three general goals: estimation, inference, 
and prediction)
2. How are foraging strategies influenced by habitat?
    - resources
    - risks
    - conditions
- Approach of habitat selection analyses
3. How is availability informed by behaviour, specifically p-s dynamics?
- Methods
    - Review  literature
        - Search
        - Game theory models, empirical, other
        - Resources, risks, conditions
        - Individual constraints
        - Related variables

Statement of position/angle

- treating producer scrounger dynamics as occurring within habitat selection, where scrounging individuals use conspecifics to identify forage habitat
- conspecifics explicitly incorporated
- whereas habitat selection is concerned about used/available by environmental variables
- focus is on how individual behaviours and conspecifics (frequency dependence) influence availability of habitat
