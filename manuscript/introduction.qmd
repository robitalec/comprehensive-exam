- Access to available resources is a prereq for animal survival
- Individual foraging
    - prey/forage selection
    - net rate of intake
    - effort/quitting time
    - balance patch quality with risks or costs
- Habitat selection offers species distributions, model inference or predictions about habitat selection
    - Behavioural selection for habitat is based in the decision when to leave a patch and where to go next @Matthioplous_2023
- Social foraging
    - See Box
    - Social foraging theory extends individual foraging theory by considering
the complexity of multiple individuals in a common resource
    - The criteria for regarding animals as social in this context simply
requires interdependence of the payoffs and penalties of their strategies
    - Animal sociality is often described as a balance between advantages and disadvantages. Social foraging theory is not centred on competing causes of sociality. Rather the payoffs and penalties are directly integrated as currencies of fitness. 
- Producer scrounger dynamics
    - Producer-scrounger dynamics consider two types of strategies. Producers search
for and find food patches. Scroungers do not search for patches and attempt to steal or divide food patches with producers
    - Frequency dependence
    - Some assumptions
    - Approaches: game theory, empirical, other simulations
- 1. How is access to available resources determined by role?
- Conspecifics influence but so does habitat
    - Habitat = resources, risks, conditions
        - habitats under this definition allow for multiple scales of selection
    - Species-habitat associations are used to understand the relationship between
species distribution and habitats (three general goals: estimation, inference, 
and prediction)
2. How are foraging strategies influenced by habitat?
    - resources
    - risks
    - conditions
- Approach of habitat selection analyses
3. How is availability informed by behaviour, specifically p-s dynamics?
- Methods
    - Review  literature
        - Search
        - Game theory models, empirical, other
        - Resources, risks, conditions
        - Individual constraints
        - Related variables

Statement of position/angle

- treating producer scrounger dynamics as occurring within habitat selection, where scrounging individuals use conspecifics to identify forage habitat
- conspecifics explicitly incorporated
- whereas habitat selection is concerned about used/available by environmental variables
- focus is on how individual behaviours and conspecifics (frequency dependence) influence availability of habitat

<!-- from discussion -->

The objective was to answer the question: "How does one's role in frequency-dependent producer-scrounger dynamics influence access to available resources considering risks and conditions during habitat selection?". From this, I defined three goals: 1) to determine how foraging strategies differ in access to available resources, 2) to determine how risks and conditions influence foraging strategies and 3) to consider how the concept of availability during habitat selection can be extended to include foraging strategies. For 1) and 2), I identified empirical tests and model predictions in the literature that contribute to our understanding of access to available resources, and the influence of habitat risks and conditions on producer-scrounger dynamics. For 3), I propose extending the concept of availability from the habitat selection literature to incorporate role in producer-scrounger dynamics.
