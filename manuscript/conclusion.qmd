## Group level or population effects

<!-- why are producer-scrounger dynamics important to consider? -->

<!--
- Population
	- Scrounging can act as a population regulator by reducing population level foraging efficiency and intake rate and allowing larger population sizes of predators (Coolen_2007)
	- Social foraging can stabilize one prey and two prey systems when scrounging is prevalent in predators (Toyokawa_2017) (Vickery_2020)
	- Scrounging can lower the growth rate of a population (Toyokawa_2017)
	- Scrounging can allow prey resources to persist at higher densities than if scrounging was absent (Toyokawa_2017) (Vickery_2020)
	- Presence of scroungers in a predator can reduce the total amount of resource acquired by the group (Vickery_2020)
	- Presence of scroungers in a predator can limit group size (Vickery_2020)
	- Presence of scroungers in a predator can limit a predator's ability to outcompete other species promoting stability and species diversity (Vickery_2020)
	- Scrounging will not stability population dynamics, food chains and competitor interactions under all cases, if scrounging is too prevalent it can push the population to extinction  	- Other factors such as food abundance, variations in weather, predators and parasites may have stronger effects that can completely obscure the effects of scrounging on populations (Vickery_2020)

## Future directions

1. Establish the relationship with conditions using experiments or observations
1. Consider different types of risks
1. Incorporate producer-scrounger role into habitat selection availability



- social foraging theory
    - how animals maximize their fitness using different strategies to forage in the presence of conspecifics
    - behaviour strategies that maximize fitness
    - related to conspecifics
- habitat selection
    - how animals maximize fitness by selecting different habitats
    - distribution of species in environmental space
    - inference about relationship between environmental variables and habitat use
    - prediction for habitat use in new temporal or spatial environments


resources often considered in producer-scrounger literature

?conspecifics considered in habitat selection literature



Maybe:

- Since dominance individuals tend to scrounge more often, use focal observations to determine dominance hierarchies 
- If dominant individual, assume step distribution more limited to producer distribution
