To address the question: "How does one's role in frequency-dependent producer-scrounger dynamics influence access to available resources considering risks and conditions during habitat selection?", I defined three goals: 1) to determine how foraging strategies differ in access to available resources, 2) to determine how risks and conditions influence foraging strategies and 3) to consider how the concept of availability during habitat selection can be extended to include foraging strategies. For 1) and 2), I identified empirical tests and model predictions in the literature that contribute to our understanding of access to resources and the influence of habitat risks and conditions. For 3), I proposed an extension to the concept of availability from habitat selection analyses to incorporate role in producer-scrounger dynamics. 
- Goal
	- 1. How is access to available resources determined by role?
	- 2. How are foraging strategies influenced by habitat?
	- 3. How is availability informed by behaviour, specifically p-s dynamics?
- Position/angle
	- Prioritize how risks and conditions influence foraging strategy
	- Identify gaps
	- Consider extensions to habitat selection from foraging
- Results
	- Reviewed literature
	- N approach, species, etc
		- The producer-scrounger dynamics has been examined using three categories of approaches: empirical tests (Table S2, 61.8 % of relevant studies), evolutionary game theory models (Table S2, 20.1 % of relevant studies) and other approaches (Table S2, 17.9 % of relevant studies). Birds , mammals and ray-finned fishes were
		- three species make up 30% of studies
		- many species with only one study

	- Fig S1
	- Group/population level outcomes
		- Scrounging can act as a population regulator by reducing population level foraging efficiency and intake rate and allowing larger population sizes of predators (Coolen_2007)
		- Social foraging can stabilize one prey and two prey systems when scrounging is prevalent in predators (Toyokawa_2017) (Vickery_2020)
		- Scrounging can lower the growth rate of a population (Toyokawa_2017)
		- Scrounging can allow prey resources to persist at higher densities than if scrounging was absent (Toyokawa_2017) (Vickery_2020)
		- Presence of scroungers in a predator can reduce the total amount of resource acquired by the group (Vickery_2020)
		- Presence of scroungers in a predator can limit group size (Vickery_2020)
		- Presence of scroungers in a predator can limit a predator's ability to outcompete other species promoting stability and species diversity (Vickery_2020)
		- Scrounging will not stability population dynamics, food chains and competitor interactions under all cases, if scrounging is too prevalent it can push the population to extinction  	- Other factors such as food abundance, variations in weather, predators and parasites may have stronger effects that can completely obscure the effects of scrounging on populations (Vickery_2020)
- Conclusions
	- Few examples of risks, conditions
	- Many individual constraints
- Future directions
	- Expand risks considered
	- Explore influence of conditions
	- Determine which variables are most important eg. dominance, spatial position beyond role
	- Incorporate role into availability in habitat selection
	- What's the priority?
		-In addition, a consideration for the broader challenges on animals is required while foraging is critical for survival, so is managing extreme temperatures which is the priority?
		- Predictions of dynamic habitat change (eg. due to anthropogenic disturbance) could be related to increases or decreases in rates of producer and scrounger strategies
