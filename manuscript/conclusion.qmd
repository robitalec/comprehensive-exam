We started with separate bodies of literature where social foraging concerns
interdependence of individual's foraging strategies and 

habitat selection concerns the relationship between used and available habitats to determine preferential selection 

They have different objectives and approaches

social foraging is focused on behaviour and observations and how individuals are theoretically (evo game theory) expected to maximize their foraging payoffs
and actually (empirically) constrained by dominance or relatedness or energy reserves




we learned that producer scrounger literature hasnt really considered risks and conditions

we learned that it is largely been tested on birds and many species have not been tested multiple times 

while there isnt a already tested relationship between habitat RRC and producer scrounger dynamics in most cases, there is a clear path forward
consider constraints and measure the influence of RRC

definition of habitat can inform future studies of producer scrounger dynamics by highlighting potentially influential variables, categorized by their expected fitness 





we also identtified a methodological connection to expand habitat selection from produycer scrounger dynamics
while the ddefinition of availability continues to be refined by considering animal's movement patterns, behaviours hahve not been as quickly adopted

we note the HMM, behavioural state approach
of which we propose should be integrated with foraging strategy 

within behavioural state, animals make different selections
eg for resting, or foraging

within behavioural states that incorporate foraging, how do foraging strategies impact availability, eg. scroungers only where nearby conspecific producers






While the producer-scrounger literature has not explicitly tested the influence of a diverse set of habitat risks and conditions (Table 1), a broad set of related variables have been identified as individual constraints (Box 3). Dominiance, relatedness and energy reserves, for example, have been shown to have large contributions to an animal's foraging strategy and their corresponding foraging success among conspecifics. In future empirical tests, risks and conditions must be carefully integrated to measure their specific relationships with foraging strategy and avoid confounding with individual constraints. In addition, more empirical tests are required on species underrepresented in the literature. Many species were only involved in one empirical test (Table S4) and entire classes of vertebrates were not represented (Table S3). Conflicts in the literature such as 

The proposed extension of resource availability to consider an individual's role in producer-scrounger dynamics offers the integration of social foraging theory and habitat selection analyses. As the concept of availaility in habitat selection has developed, the subset of habitat that is realistically accessible has been constrained using variables related to the animal's movement. By incorporating behaviours, the distinctions between available and accessible habitats can be further refined. Consider first categorizingg an animal's movement according to a particular behavioural mode, eg. exploratory or encamped. Within encamped animal telemetry dataFirs, animal's behavioural mode, eg. foraging or encamped,
