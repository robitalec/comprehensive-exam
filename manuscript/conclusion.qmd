## Future directions

1. Establish the relationship with conditions using experiments or observations
1. Consider different types of risks
1. Incorporate producer-scrounger role into habitat selection availability



- social foraging theory
    - how animals maximize their fitness using different strategies to forage in the presence of conspecifics
    - behaviour strategies that maximize fitness
    - related to conspecifics
- habitat selection
    - how animals maximize fitness by selecting different habitats
    - distribution of species in environmental space
    - inference about relationship between environmental variables and habitat use
    - prediction for habitat use in new temporal or spatial environments


resources often considered in producer-scrounger literature

?conspecifics considered in habitat selection literature



Maybe:

- Since dominance individuals tend to scrounge more often, use focal observations to determine dominance hierarchies 
- If dominant individual, assume step distribution more limited to producer distribution
