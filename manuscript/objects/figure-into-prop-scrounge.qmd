Figure 2: Graph visualization of all variables directly and indirectly related to the proportion of scrounging behaviour identified in the reviewed literature (Table S1). The variables shown are a subset of the full graph (Figure S1) to focus on the proportion of scrounging in a group. The color of the lines indicates the nature of the relationship: blue indicates a positive relationship, red indicates a negative relationship, black indicates a neutral relationship, orange indicates a convex relationship and grey indicates subcategories. For example, group size has a positive relationship with learning [@Smolla_2015], patch richness has a negative relationship with finder share [@Teichroeb_2015], energy reserves has a neutral relationship with proportion of scroungers [@Lee_2016a], adults and juveniles are a subcategory of age, and time of day has a convex relationship with proportion of scrounger [@Barta_2000]. Linetypes indicate the approach of the study that contributed this relationship where solid lines are producer-scrounger models using evolutionary game theory and dashed lines are empirical tests. For example, the relationship between group size andd learning was contributed by an evolutionary game theory model [@Smolla_2015] and the relationship between patch richness and finder share  was contributed by an empirical test [@Teichroeb_2015]. Note that multiple lines may be drawn between the same pair of variables and when they are differently colored it indicates a disagreement in the reviewed articles. Citations for multiple articles that contributed the same approach (linetype) and nature of relationship (color) are combined in a list. Citations are always found above the line between the two variables. The graph visualization was built using GraphViz [@Gansner_2000].
