# Outline

## Foraging with others

*What are the costs, benefits of sociality with respect to foraging?*

-   positives

    -   foraging benefit

    -   conserving energy, heat

-   negatives

    -   reduced local food supply

    -   interference

    -   kleptoparasitism

Related,

-   positives

    -   predator dilution, vigilance

-   negatives

    -   increased attack rate

    -   disease/parasite load

## Social foraging theory

Economic interdependence of payoffs and penalties for multiple foragers

-   *How does social foraging theory differ from individual foraging theory?*

-   *What is the chronological history of literature preceding social foraging theory that brings us to producer-scrounger dynamics?*

Criterion of sociality

Approaches

-   observational, comparative

-   optimization

    -   Evolutionary game theory

        -   Evolutionary stable strategies

        -   Nash equilibrium

Assumptions

-   strategies

    -   *how do strategies relate to alleles, phenotypes, and plasticity?*

-   populations

    -   finite or infinite

-   play

    -   repeated or single round

    -   information: uninformed or informed play

-   games

    -   symmetric

    -   discrete

Classes of behaviours among social foragers

### Producer-scrounger dynamics

-   *How are producer-scrounger dynamics defined and what are their assumptions?*

-   

#### Assumptions

-   producers search for food

-   handling time is minimal

-   one or more scroungers find food after producer

-   scroungers can steal, or share and divide food with producer

##### Information

How does assumption of information influence ESS of producer scrounger games

##### Extras

Memory

#### Interactions between strategies

-   How do producers/scroungers/opportunists interact?
