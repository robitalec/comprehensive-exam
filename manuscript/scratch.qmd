# Question parsed

“In the context of frequency-dependent producer-scrounger dynamics, how would one’s role affect access to available resources considering risks and conditions during habitat selection?”

- frequency-dependent
- producer-scrounger dynamics
- role
	- as a producer
	- as a scrounger
	- interaction variables
		- dominance
		- metabolic state
		- genetic relatedness
		- spatial position in group
		- learning

		- individual differences
- access to
- available 
- resources
- risks
- conditions
- habitat selection
