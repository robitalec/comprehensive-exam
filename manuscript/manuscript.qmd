Access to available resources is a prerequisite for animal survival

Advantages in accessing resources can translate to an increase in 
individual fitness

At the species level, there are eg. differences in specialization/generalization
of resources, migratory behaviours, etc

Within species, individuals use behavioural strategies to meet energetic needs
including prey/forage selection, effort/quitting time, balancing environmental
variables, eg. temperature or insect harassment, with patch quality

Mobile prey represent a dynamic resource in space that requires predators to
first search out, then capture before consuming

Immobile prey, such as sedentary animals or lifestages of animals or plants, 
represent static resources in space 

Both mobile and immobile prey can also have temporal cycles through 
seasons of plant productivity or potential timing of antipredator behaviours / 
increased risks eg. reproductive timing
