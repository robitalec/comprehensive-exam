Access to available resources is a prerequisite for animal survival

Advantages in accessing resources can translate to an increase in 
individual fitness

At the species level, there are eg. differences in specialization/generalization
of resources, migratory behaviours, etc

Within species, individuals use behavioural strategies to meet energetic needs
including prey/forage selection, effort/quitting time, balancing environmental
variables, eg. temperature or insect harassment, with patch quality

Mobile prey represent a dynamic resource in space that requires predators to
first search out, then capture before consuming

Immobile prey, such as plants, or sedentary animals (or specific lifestages of animals), 
represent relatively static resources in space requiring search then 
potential handling 

Both mobile and immobile prey can also have temporal cycles through 
seasons of plant productivity or potential timing of antipredator behaviours / 
increased risks for prey eg. reproductive timing

Individual foraging theory emphasizes the selection of prey, net rate of intake
and attack probabilities for individuals

Social foraging theory extends individual foraging theory by considering
the complexity of multiple individuals in a common resource

The criteria for regarding animals as social in this context simply
requires interdependence of the payoffs and penalties of their strategies

Social foraging theory is grounded in evolutionary game theory and it seeks to 
determine optimal strategies given density and behaviour of conspecifics

Payoffs and penalties are integrated as currencies of fitness and not 
as competing causes of sociality

Payoffs can include

Penalties can include
