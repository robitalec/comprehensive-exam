It is comprised of patch departure rules or giving up rates and the decision where to go next. Habitats are defined in terms of resources, risks and conditions. Environmental variables corresponding to these three can have complex interactions.\nProducer-scrounger dynamics consider the payoffs and penalties of strategies given the density of conspecifics and their corresponding strategies. A strategy whose fitness cannot be improved given the current environment and set of conspecifics’ strategies or a strategy that resists the invasion of a rare alternative is an evolutionary stable strategy.\nRisks are integrated differently in producer-scrounger dynamics and habitat selection. Predation risk, for example, is directly incorporated into the penalty for each strategy in a producer-scrounger game. For habitat selection, predation risk would make up one of the relevant environmental variables under the risk category that define a habitat, with an expected negative relationship with fitness.\nHow are conditions considered for producer-scrounger dynamics other than extreme conditions that represent potential penalties?\nFor habitat selection, conditions form a subset of the environmental variables that make up a habitat.\nHow do producers and scroungers differ in their access to available resources?\n\nthis relates to ESSs for different densities and proportion of producers/scroungers\naccess for producers is high when density is low, because the number of available patches is high and they are more efficient than scroungers at searching for them\naccess for scroungers is low when density is low, because the overall number of producers is low and therefore low scrounging potential\naccess for producers is lower when density is high because unoccupied patches are lower\naccess for scroungers is higher when density is high because more producers have found more patches and scrounging potential is higher\n\n\n\n\nThe goal is to determine how risks and conditions of habitats influence access to available resources for individuals in frequency dependent producer-scrounger dynamics\n\nCan this be rephrased/clarified?\n\n\n\nThe ideal data for relating risks and conditions during habitat selection to producer-scrounger dynamics is a controlled experiment:\n\nlong term observations of multiple tanks\ntanks differ in their density\nareas in tanks have habitats that have a measurable influence on fitness or a relevant proxy\nhabitats are not depletable\nwithin habitats, food is available on patches that require some degree of searching. food is not freely available\nvary risks across habitats\nvary conditions across habitats\n\n\nrecord individuals in tanks\ntag individuals through time as producers or scroungers\nidentify habitat selected by individuals along with associated risks and conditions\nrepeat observations of individuals\ncompare results across tanks with different densities\ncompare results across habitats with different risks, conditions\n\n\n\n\nGame theoretical model of producer-scrounger dynamic where resources, risks and conditions of the habitat are integrated into the payoffs and penalties\n\nAlternative?\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do the ideal and available differ?\nWhy do they differ?\nHow can the available approach answer the question?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactions:\nA. frequency dependent producer-scrounger dynamics model incorporating risks and conditions of habitat B. social habitat selection model of simulated data extending from individuals were together in X habitat to producer scrounger / leader into patch and follower\nrequires:\nSpecies habitat associations are used for: - spatial estimation of density - inference about why species occur in particular locations - prediction of species distribution in a new time and/or space\nScale\n\n\n\n\nFrequency independent (Stephens Krebs)\n\nMax\nMin\n\nFrequency depedent (Maynard Smith 1982)\n\nStability\n\n\n\n\n\nAllee effects\n\n\nParasite load\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Scrounging payoffs are negatively frequency dependent”\n\n\n\n\n\nresources\nrisks\nconditions ### Resources Resources\ndepletable\nnot\n\n\n\n\nunpredictable resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImperfect information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual\n\nStephens Krebs\n\nDyad, group\n\nSFT\nProducer scrounger\n\nSpecies, populations\n\nSHA\nHabitat selection\nSDM\n\nMultispecies\n\nSHA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmobility\nspatial scales of perception\n\n\n\n\n\nRules for game theory eg 2.1.3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESS Fitness Population dynamics\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial foraging theory Explicit consideration of payoffs and penalties\n\n\n\nSpecies distribution models, species habitat associations\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www-webofscience-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/wos/woscc/summary/081aaf7e-e39b-4500-aac2-e44bcf21d3f6-78707ffd/relevance/1\n\n“habitat selection”\n\nhttps://www-webofscience-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/wos/woscc/summary/b091d426-d8ea-4e4e-824c-3fda822b700d-7912459f/relevance/1\n“producer-scrounger” OR “producer scrounger” OR producer scrounger AND 1970-2023\n233 results\n\n41 Giraldeau\n12 Beauchamp G\n10 Barta Z\n8 Morrand-ferron J, Ranta E, Webster MM, Laland KN, Feldman MW\n…\n\nPeak in 2012-2016, 2002, 2006"

Approaches used included producer-scrounger models using evolutionary game theory, empirical tests, other approaches and not relevant. For empirical tests, species and taxonomic classes were recorded. Article information also includes year of publication, journal, authors and title. Literature was obtained using a search for “producer” and “scrounger” in the titles, abstracts and keywords of articles in the databases SCOPUS, Web of Science and Biological Abstracts. Literature was filtered to remove duplicates using article’s DOI (Script 1).\nTable S2: Counts of approaches in producer-scrounger dynamics literature. Approaches used in the reviewed literature (Table S1) were classified as producer-scrounger dynamic models using evolutionary game theory appproaches, empirical tests, other approaches, or not relevant. Some articles used multiple approaches therefore the total count is larger than the total number of articles reviewed. Other approaches included, for example, agent-based simulations and genetic algorithms. Approaches were deemed not relevant when they did not explicitly model or test producer-scrounger dynamics and included them solely in the article’s keywords, introduction or discussion content. Counts are summarized using mean, median and total sum of counts across approaches.\nTable S3: Counts of taxonomic classes in empirical tests of producer-scrounger dynamics. Approaches used in the reviewed literature (Table S1) were classified as producer-scrounger dynamic models using evolutionary game theory appproaches, empirical tests, or other approaches. Some articles used multiple approaches. For each empirical test, species and taxonomic classes were recorded for each article. In some cases, multiple species were studied in a single article therefore these counts are occurence in articles and the total count is larger than the total number of empirical studies. Counts are summarized using mean, median and total sum of counts across taxonomic classes.\nTable S4: Counts of species in empirical tests of producer-scrounger dynamics.

The variables shown are a subset of the full graph (Figure S1) to focus on the proportion of scrounging in a group. The relationships are also a subset of the full graph, where relationships to other outcome variable are excluded. For example, the relationship between patch richness and rate of aggression (Dubois 2003) is not shown because the relationship between proportion of scroungers and rate of aggression was not explicitly tested in the reviewed literature. Some variables influencing proportion of scroungers are related to access and availability of resource. Patch size (King 2009, Hansen 2016) and patch distribution (Dubois 2020, Ohtsuka 2009) had a positive relationship with proportion of scrounging whereasa patch discovery rate (Ohtsuka 2009, Lee 2016), and finder share (Barta 1998, Lee 2016) had a negative relationship with proportion of scrounging. Beyond environmental variables, many other individual constraints are found to have influences on the proportion of scrounging including dominance (Caraco_1989, Barta_1998, Bugnyar_2002, Werdenich_2002, King_2009, Lee_2016, Aplin_2017),energy reserves (Lendvai 2004, Lee 2016a), relatedness (Maathot 2010) and social affiliation (King 2009). Predation risks (and proxies to simulate predation risk) were the only form of risk considered in the reviewed producer-scrounger literature (Table 1) and there were conflicting results where Dubois’s game theoretical approach (2020) predicted a negative relationship with scrounging while Barta (2004) and Mathot (2007) found a positive relationship.\nFigure 3 shows the graph visualization of all variables directly and indirectly related to the group level effects of scrounging behaviour identified in the reviewed literature (Table S1). The variables shown are a subset of the full graph (Figure S1) to focus on group level effects. The relationships are also a subset of the full graph, where some direct relationships with proportion of scroungers are not shown to emphasize group level effects. For example, energy reserves and patch density had direct relationships with proportion of scroungers in the group (Figure 2). Some group level outcomes are related to access and availability of resources. Proportion of scroungers in a group has a negative relationship with the total quantity foraged by the group (Vickery 2020) and the group’s patch discovery rate (Coolen 2002). Notably, dominance has a positive relationship with forage access and both dominance and energy reserves have a positive relationship with foraging efficiency, illustrating the constraints on individuals that can influence foraging strategy beyond patch payoffs and penalties (Caraco 1979, Teichroeb 2015, Lee 2016a).\nFigure S1 shows the graph visualization of all variables directly and indirectly related to producer-scrounger dynamics identified in the reviewed literature. The full graph has been reduced to emphasize two groups of variables in Figure 2 and Figure 3. The variables that directly and indirectly contribute to the proportion of scrounging in a group are shown in Figure 2. The group or population level effects of the proportion of scrounging and related variables are shown in Figure 3. The complexity of the full graph indicates the interconnectedness of animals’ environments, conspecifics and potential constraints in foraging. Notably, there are few environmental variables beyond resource patch characteristics such as patch richness, distribution, and size. Social variables including relatedness, affiliations and dominance are well described. Some notable disagreements in the literature include the relationship between antipredator vigilance and scrounging behaviour (Ranta 1996, Ranta 1998, Mathot 2007), age related differences in scrounging behaviour (Teichroeb 2015, Aplin 2017), and the contribution of learning on the frequency of scrounging behaviour (Afshar 2015. Aplin 2017).\nTable S2 shows the counts of approaches used to study producer-scrounger dynamics in the reviewed literature (Table S1). Of the literature deemed relevant, an empirical approach was used in 62 % of studies (N = 86 / 139), an producer-scrounger model with an evolutionary game theory approach was used in 20 % of studies (N = 28 / 139) and other approaches were used in 18 % of studies (N = 25 / 139). Five articles used multiple approaches including the earliest study where Barnard and Sibly (1981) used both a producer-scrounger model and an empirical test.\nTable S3 shows the counts of species studied in empirical tests of producer-scrounger dynamics in the reviewed literature (Table S1). Three species of birds (spice finches (Lonchura punctulata), zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and house sparrows (Passer domesticus)) make up 35 % (N = 33 / 93) of studied species. Notably, all other species were studied only three or less times with 34 species only being studied once.\nTable S4 shows the counts of taxonomic classes studied in empirical tests of producer-scrounger dynamics in the reviewed literature (Table S1). There is a majority representation of Aves. The earliest empirical tests of producer-scrounger dynamics included Barnard and Sibley’s work on house sparrows (Passer domesticus) (1981) and Giraldeau and Lefebvre’s work on pigeons (Columba livia) (1986). Di Bitetti and Janson’s test of producer-scrounger dynamics on capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) (2001) was the first empirical test of producer-scrounger dynamics on a mammalian species. Western buffalo breams (Kyphosus cornelii) were the first ray-finned fish species (Hamilton and Dill 2003). Finally in 2016, producer-scrounger dynamics were tested in arachnids (Dumke et al 2016) and insects (Katz and Naug 216). Notable vertebrate groups that are not represented in the results of this literature survey include reptiles, amphibians, jawless fishes, lobe-finned fishes and cartilagenous fishes."

It only considers the outcome of a potentially instantaneous learning rule. Other costs of learning involve sampling leading to inefficient foraging, and the metabolic or energetic costs of maintaining the learning physiology\nPersonality polymorphisms are thought to be maintained as the consequence of strong trade-offs between benefits and costs across ecological contexts and different selective forces acting at different times during an organism’s life history. The need to make repeated foraging strategy decisions is probably sufficient to predict the learning polymorphisms.

Concerned with the functional advantage of sociality. Assume all individuals search independently while simultaneously observing each other. When a patch is found, all individuals feed on it. This assumption if called complete compatibility.\nUnlike [information-sharing-models], producer-scrounger models do not assume all group members behave in the same way. Some individuals specialize in producing and others in scrounging. At a given play of the game, a producer cannot scrounger and a scrounger cannot produce. This assumption is called complete incompatibility.\nThese two extremes are likely unrealistic with partial compatibility being more likely. Trading off predator vigilance and feeding rate, and specializing on particular forage types.\n\n\n\nproducers\nscroungers\nopportunists (can produce or scrounge at a reduced efficiency)\n\n\n\n\n\neffective group size\npatch discovery rate decreased with less producers\nscrounger’s portion decreases for each patch with more scroungers\n\n\n\n\n\nscarce patches of divisible food items\nlong search time relative to patch exploitation time\nfinder’s share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatchy resources may lead to larger group size and more scroungers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduction of sensory contact between individuals, eg. wind or fog, likely reduce group size and favor increased proportion of producers\n\n\n\nAssumed that producers have a finder’s share before scroungers and opportunities arrive at the patch. The remainder is divided equally between the producer and all scroungers (including opportunists), where the total consumed by scroungers is the scrounger’s share.\nSolitary foraging could be a solution for producers to avoid sharing with scroungers. This may not be possible when food is localized and presence of others cannot be escaped. Trade off of others balanced with predation risk.\n\n\n\nReconcile information-sharing and producer-scrounger models of group foraging\n\n\n\nThese three strategies can only coexist when opportunist’s loss in searching ability is exactly equal to its gain in scrounging ability. All pairs of strategies can coexist, depending on relative producing ability and relative scrounging ability of opportunists and the finder’s share."

Scrounging limits group size, impact on prey and ability of a predator to outcompete other species, promoting stability and species diversity.\nHigher growth rates of the resource require high scrounging frequencies to prevent instability on the system. Low growth rates allow coexistence only when the finder’s advantage is high and scrounging frequency is low.

These models were static and state independent and could not explore whether time of day, animal’s state and degree of predation hazard influenced individual decisions to use either strategy\nNext steps: incorporate dominance asymmetries and allow foragers the choice to forage alone\n\n\nProducer, scrounger\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen scrounging is rare, it is assumed to do better than the producer alternative because it can take advantage of the many exploitable food patches discovered by the producers. When scrounging is common, the number of individuals competing as scroungers increases and the payoffs for scroungers declines.\nSurvival probability is the currency used here instead of net food intake to determine how the use of either strategy impacts individuals’ survival probability\n\n\n\nThe nighttime non foraging period reduces animal’s energy reserves that are replenished during daylight. Foraging increases risk of predation while resting decreases risk of predation while consuming energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredation / hazard risk. Scroungers surveying for producers finding patches also provides a lower predation hazard as a by-product and to include this, the authors set the predation hazard for scroungers to half that of the producers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll scroungers get equal access to each producer’s patch minus the producer’s share. Patch-finding rate and amount of food in a patch were constant. Varying patchiness did not change the average daily stable proportion of scrounging but increasing patchiness decreased the probability of survival in most cases.\n\n\n\nState-dependent dynamic producer-scrounger game that predicts early in the day when energy reserves are low, individuals will prefer the scrounger strategy. Late in the day, individuals will favor the producer strategy. Under rich and clumped food, scrounging will improve daily survival of all group members.\n\n\n\nThe proportion of individuals scrounging is predicted to change through the day, highest around dawn and dusk and lowest around midday because the scrounger obtains small amounts of food in a reliable way while the producer either acquires high or no food intake. Producing is optimal in midday if individuals are near or above their critical reserve level because if a producer is successful they are likely able to switch to resting sooner and avoid predation hazard."

This is due to the finders_share that lets producers pay more for defense than a scrounger can for appropriation.\nIncreasing group size will increase the rate of playing scrounger and increase the costs of aggression. Few scroungers are expected at the equilibrium when the number of foragers is small.\nIncreasing patch density will reduce the time required for producers to find patches and the temporal costs associated with aggressive appropriation will make scrounger less profitable. Encounters will decline as the number of producers increases.\nIncreasing patch richness will increase the scrounger’s share and the proportion of scroungers within the group. Scroungers are more likely to get required food to offset expenses of aggressive appropriation.\nCosts of aggression increase with predation pressure as the increased probability of being killed by a predator while engaged in a fight increase. Aggression should reduce when predation hazard increases but non-aggressive scroungers will be unsuccessful securing food from aggressive producers. Otherwise, scroungers are likely to switch to producing, reducing the proportion of scroungers and decreasing the number of challenges but with lower numbers of scroungers, the aggressiveness increases."

Perception of risk may be just as influential, see Landre_et_al_2010.\nPresence of risks may limit actual presence of species, eg. where hosts are missing where parasites exist.\nrisks are often dynamic processes that are difficult to quantify. See Palmer_et_al_2017.\n\n\n\nconditions are environmental variables that surround the organism and influence its functioning.\n\nambient temperature\nsalinity\nhumidity\n\nconditions can have positive, negative or ambivalent effects on fitness. Eg. outside of limits of ambient temperature, organisms can die or stop functioning properly.\nSee Oddling_Smee_et_al_2013 for modification of conditions by organisms.\n\n\n\n\nresources - risks\n\n“Is it worth the risk?” (Brown_and_Kotler_2004)\neg. predation risks causing organisms to avoid high resource density areas (McNammara_and_Houston_1987)\nSurviving individuals in areas of high risk will have lower resource competition which may lead to an increase in overall population fitness (Van_Leeuwen_et_al_2008)\n\nresources - conditions\n\nEnvironmental conditions influence on detection and intake of resources\neg. depth and sediment type on accessibility of marine invertebrates to predators (De_Goeij_and_Honkoop_2022)\n\nrisks - conditions\n\neg. detection risk of prey by predator given canopy cover (Brown_and_Koetler_2004)\n\nresources - risks - conditions\n\neg. warm blooded marine mammals in polar environments, balancing risk of hypothermia with prey resource under cold temperature conditions (Grady_et_al_2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation is at the outset of an analysis, define habitat as a point in environmental space whose dimensions are environmental variables (resources, risks, conditions). This habitat is aspatial and species agnostic but can be used to map onto geographic space and/or determine species specific associations.\n\nIs habitat a place or a set of circumstances?\n\nA region in space intuitively captures the environmental variables. However this perspective has methodological disadvantages: - requires space to be divided apriori into parts which presents challenges given nested spatial scales - scale depends on species’ mobility and perception - environment is dynamic, changing seasonally or abruptly given anthropogenic or natural drivers - models specific to one location can be challenging to use for predictions to new locations\n\nShould habitat comprise just conditions or also include resources and risks?\n\nFor distribution of moving animals, resource selection functions (Manly_et_al_2002) initially included only food selection, later also incorporated conditions and risks.\nAll three types of environmental variables (resources, risks and conditions) ultimately influence fitness and distribution. Complex interactions between them prevent considering them in total isolation. Therefore, the definition of habitat necessarily includes all three.\n\nIs habitat specific specific or independent?\n\nProblems with specific specific definitions of habitat:\n\nit is unknown apriori which environmental variables will be relevant to any focal species\nthe inferred relationship between species and habitat is not binary and models must allow for gradients of suitability\n\n\n\n\nA species-habitat association connects habitats to observations of a species (at the individual, group or population levels).\n\n\nHabitat-associated fitness is the contribution of each unit of habitat, X, to the populations long term log-rate of change. Partial fitness (Matthiopolous_et_al_2015) can be interpreted as the fitness of population living in an environment of entirely habitat X.\nMechanisms of habitat-associated fitness:\n\nsub-organismal\nlevel of physiological capabilities\nanatomy\nlife history strategies\n\n\n\n\nOrganisms experiencing low fitness must relocate or face demographic consequences. Relation involves movement of individuals, groups or populations. Their movement trajectories are an indication animals response to environments.\n\nmovements that are localized, sinuous indicate high resource availability\n\nThe density of species that cannot relocate will be affected by habitat-mediated survival and reproduction.\n\n\n\nDynamics modify the relationship between habitat and species density.\nSpatial variation in density:\n\ndoes not reflect short term (minute/hour/day) mechanisms\ndoes reflect accumulated effects of processes operating at longer time scales (year/generations)\n\n\n\n\nAssociations with fitness represent the fundamental niche of a species. The realized niche is represented by the eventual species distribution. The difference between these two are the dynamics represented by the associations between habitat and mechanisms of change in species distribution. Species distribution is not necessarily proportion to fitness.\n\n\n\n\nDynamic mechanisms shape the relationship between fitness and species distribution\n\nindividual level: relative use of habitats\npopulation level: demographic forces\n\n\n\nIt is important to consider and incorporate the underlying mechanisms or emergent, accessibility constraints shaping individual movement into models. Voluntary movement is made up of decision to leave, and where to go.\n\nStay or go, decision to leave.\n\nPatch departure rules, giving up times. See Charnov_1976, Brown_1988\nmarginal-value-theorem posits once an individual depletes local resources to a point where their intake is less than their average long term intake rate, they should leave the patch (Charnov_1976).\nActual/perceived long term intake rate may change due to environmental change or learning abilities. Animal often cannot instantaneously determine what local intake rate is, so they need to learn. Learning takes time and may lead to suboptimal decisions particularly if the environmental is unpredictable.\nSee Ollason_1980, Biernaskie_et_al_2009, Kamil_et_al_2019, Riotte_Lambert_et_al_2019\n\nWhere to go\n\nAnimal may move:\n\nrandomly, eg. isotropic or correlated random walks\ndirected movement based on\n\nsensory perception (Fagan_et_al_2013)\nspatial memory (Bracis_2017)\ninformation from conspecifics (Jesner_2018, Oliveira_Santos_2016, Merkle_2019)\n\n\nCognitive processes operate at several, widely different scales\n\n\n\nThe distribution of all organisms (vs behavioural selection) is shaped by demographic processes highly dependent on spatially heterogeneous environmental variables.\nIt is difficult to tease apart the contributions of demographic processes and animal mobility on distributions. Eg. selection bias of observations since animals tagged with eg. GPS trackers are alive in capture location and therefore demographic sorting has already taken place and we can only study their behavioural selection.\n\n\n\n\nOften we assume that high local density indicates that the local habitat is good for species. This is not necessarily the case, but if it is, the assumptions of the following null model can be used to related the intrinsic fitness of a habitat with species distribution.\n\n\nNull models are mathematical constructs derived from sets of assumptions that form the basis for discussion on a physical process. Eg.\n\nlogistic model of population dynamics\nmodel of perfect mixing in predator prey dynamics\nmarginal-value-theorem\nneutral theory of biodiversity\n\nFor species-habitat associations, there has historically been an implicit null model without explicit mathematical formulation or assumptions.\n\n\n\nAssumptions\n\nhighly mobile dispersal stage, all space is equally accessible to all of its propagules\ncompletely sessile reproductive stage, local density results from local habitat quality\nintrinsic population growth solely driven by habitat, with positive values everywhere\nlocal population growth declines with local density\nno interspecific competition\n\nSee the book for full derivation of these formulas\nSee Matthiopolous_et_al_2015 where population growth rate relates to fitness of a population\n\\(N_{s, t+1} = N_{s, t} exp(F_{0}(x) - b N_{s, t})\\)\n\n\\(N_{s, t+1}\\): local population density at t + 1\n\\(N_{s, t}\\): local population density at t\n\\(F_{0}(x)\\): intrinsic fitness value of habitat\n\\(b\\): attrition on population growth of an added individual\n\nWhere the population density is very small, growth rate is equal to the intrinsic growth rate.\nWhere the population density is at an equilibrium local density, attrition caused by density dependence annuls the benefits of habitat and the equilibrium distribution is proportional to intrinsic growth rate.\n\n\n\nBuilding on Fretwell_and_Lucas_1969 who consider the distribution of an ideal free species a purely behavioural phenomenon without demographic sorting.\nAssumptions\n\nindividuals are ideal, aware of the value of all patches and make rational ideal choices\nindividuals are free, they can select any patch and all individual are identical\n\nThe first individual will select the patch with the highest baseline suitability rate. By using this patch, the suitability with decrease. This is repeated for all individuals and eventually all patches will have equal suitability.\nSee the book for full derivation of these formulas\n\\(S(x, N_{s, t}) = B_{x} - f(N_{s, t})\\)\n\n\\(S\\): suitability of a given location\n\\(x\\): set of environmental variables\n\\(N_{s, t}\\): density\n\\(B_{x}\\): baseline suitability\n\\(f\\): growth rate/fitness\n\nMechanisms: interference and scramble-competition (Krivan_et_al_2008)\nUnder the first assumption, the baseline suitability is approximately the intrinsic value of the habitat (at low density) and the suitability is approximately the fitness/growth rate.\nFor each population there will be a unique ideal-free-distribution M. Where fitness declines linearly with local population size and where the population size M is at carrying capacity, we can set the equation equal to 0 and solve.\n\\(N_{S}^{*} = F_{0} / b\\)\nThe relationship between density and habitat suitability or fitness is identical to that for the ideal life history organism when the total population size is at carrying capacity.\n\n\n\nData on intrinsic growth rate are difficult to collect and observe since they require small population sizes. At equilibrium, “bad” patches will have locally extinct populations. If a limiting resource driving fitness is depletable, the abundance and distribution will differ between low and high densities.\nAt earlier stages of population growth and resource depletion, the correlation between food distribution and growth rates delivers an informative species-habitat association. At equilibrium distribution, depletion distorts inferences. Equilibrium density of the consumer will yield no relationship with food density but a strong positive relationship with food production/replenishment/productivity.\n\n\n\n\nProportional relationships between distribution and density is violated by\n\nNon linear relationships\nEquilibrium never reached due to demography, mobility and changing environments\n\n\n\nObservations only capture occupancy/vacancy rather than continuous measures of suitability\nSpecies density and fitness can also be positively related eg. where increasing group size results in decreased predation risks, increases information transfer and services and allee effects (see Allee_1951, Stephens_and_Sutherland_1999).\n\n\n\nOrganisms are often encountered in poor quality habitats\n\ntransient state (Matthiopolous_et_al_2020)\nextinction debt where individuals are pushed to poor quality habitats, time lag as population declines\n\nZero niche paradox: viable animal populations in landscapes with no points of positive fitness. This can occur due to transient resources or conditions, or movement to enture overall positive fitness considering resources, risks and conditions.\n\n\n\n\nColonization credit (Watts_et_al_2020)\nMismatches may be due to imperfect information or dynamic environments\nSite fidelity (Matthiopolous_et_al_2005)\nEltonian viewpoint (Soberon_2007)\nLandscapes of fear\n\n\n\n\n\nKey desire to assume: pseudo equilibrium assumption where presence is suitable and absence is unsuitable.\nGuisan_and_Huiller_2005 Gallion_et_al_2012\nMechanisms that violate null models:\n\nspecies abundance not consistently indicative of habitat suitability gradients\nspecies survive in areas of negative fitness\nextinction debts\ncolonization credits\n\nSo far, species distribution models inferences are only valid under the assumptions of the null model.

    "text": "Giraldeau, L.A. and Caraco, T., 2000. Social foraging theory. Princeton University Press.\n\n\n\nSocial foraging differs from individual foraging theory in that it requires economic interdependence of payoffs and penalties. An individual’s foraging behaviour and its functional consequence depends on the actions of the individual and the behaviour of other foragers. The majority of this book’s attention is on consequences for individuals with some on communities.\nComparing individual foraging theory, eg. Stephens_and_Krebs_1986, to social foraging theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual foraging theory\nSocial foraging theory\n\n\n\n\nPrey selection strategy for an individual involves attack probabilities for different prey and net rate of intake\nAdded complexity of considering 2+ predators for a shared clump of prey\n\n\n\nSocial criterion: 2+ individuals concurrently influence each other’s gains and losses\nHistorically, social groups are defined as individuals that derive evolutionary advantages from the presence of others while aggregations do not. Genuine attraction between individuals vs merely statistical coincidence.\nThis obscures the similarities between animals with complex social structures and those without. Eg. lions (complex) and pigeons (simpler/loose) both have food available to an individual dependent on the number of foragers in the group. Regardless of however “social” they can both be modelled with a similar social foraging model.\nSocial foraging theory is not the study of the origin of foraging groups. Social foraging does not treat antipredatory and energetic benefits as competing causes. Both are integrated into the currency of fitness.\nApproaches to social foraging theory:\n\ncomparative method correlating ecological conditions to population/species attributes\noptimization techniques\n\ncriticisms: Cohen_1976, Launde_1982, Gray_1987, Hines_1987\nresponses: Maynard_Smith_1978, Oster_Wislson_1978, Mayr_1983, Krebs_Davies_1984, Stephens_Krebs_1986, Schoener_1987\n\n\nNash equilibrium is a set of strategies (one for each player) such that no player can improve its payoff by changing strategy vs the other Nash equilibrium strategies. Nash equilibriums are stable if unilateral deviation reduces payoff.\nAn evolutionary-stable-strategy maximizes a player’s expected payoff. Stability may imply dynamics resistant to invasion by a rare strategy, or the consequences for an individual deviating from the evolutionary-stable-strategy. All evolutionary-stable-strategy are Nash equilibriums.\n\nStrategies may be\n\ndirectly equivalent to alleles\nmodified by the environment\nPure strategies are where there is a single action\n\nPopulations may be\n\nfinite\ninfinite\n\nPlay may be\n\nrepeated or not (single round)\ninformed or uninformed where each player chooses their action without knowledge of the action other players will take\n\nGames\n\nSymmetric where there is competitive equivalence of players with the same payoffs and penalties. No phenotypic attributes of individuals.\nDiscrete where each action is from a discrete set\n\n\nThis complexity has theoretical significance. The authors’ recommendation is to focus on phenotype. Assume selection has enhanced learning capacity and individuals can efficiently vary behaviour across environmental and social conditions.\nBox 1.1 Classes of behaviours that may occur among social foragers\n\nSelfish behaviour (positive effect on individual and negative on relatives)\nCooperative behaviour\n\nGroup selected altruism\nUnconditional cooperation\n\nKin-directed altruism (negative or neutral effect on individual and positive effect on relatives)\nMutualism (positive effect on individual and relatives)\n\nConditional cooperation\n\nReciprocal altruism\nConditional mutualism\n\n\n\nSearching\n\nat least some group members attempt to find food\nothers may avoid the cost of searching\nactive foragers may focus on different resources\ntime to locate patch depends on the number of individuals searching and their interacting efficiencies\nfood searching is treated as stochastic\n\nDividing\n\nfood is actively shared, divided equally\nallocated asymmetrically according to eg. dominance status\n\nThree types of social foragers\n\nProducers: search environment for food\nScroungers: do not search directly. They attend to other forager’s clump discoveries and aggressively or stealthily sequester some food\nOpportunist: both search directly and obtain food at clumps located by producers or opportunists. They are assumed less efficient than producers and scroungers.\n\nInteractions between types of social foragers\n\nProducer vs producer: equilibrium group size under controlled group-entry\nProducer vs scrounger: require some number of producers, depends on the cost of scrounging\nProducer vs opportunist: this interaction is not maintained under symmetric competition (Pulliam_and_Caraco_1984). Greater dominance status for opportunists or more efficient searching by producers will favor one or the other type.\nOpportunist vs opportunist: information-sharing systems, equivalent to group size under free entry\nScrounger vs opportunist: can persist due to knowledge limitation"
