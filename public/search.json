Social foraging theory is not centred on competing causes of sociality.

Producers search for and find food patches.

It is comprised of patch departure rules or giving up rates and the decision where to go next. Habitats are defined in terms of resources, risks and conditions. Environmental variables corresponding to these three can have complex interactions.\nProducer-scrounger dynamics consider the payoffs and penalties of strategies given the density of conspecifics and their corresponding strategies. A strategy whose fitness cannot be improved given the current environment and set of conspecifics’ strategies or a strategy that resists the invasion of a rare alternative is an evolutionary stable strategy.\nRisks are integrated differently in producer-scrounger dynamics and habitat selection.

Perception of risk may be just as influential, see Landre_et_al_2010.\nPresence of risks may limit actual presence of species, eg. where hosts are missing where parasites exist.\nrisks are often dynamic processes that are difficult to quantify. See Palmer_et_al_2017.\n\n\n\nconditions are environmental variables that surround the organism and influence its functioning.\n\nambient temperature\nsalinity\nhumidity\n\nconditions can have positive, negative or ambivalent effects on fitness. Eg. outside of limits of ambient temperature, organisms can die or stop functioning properly.\nSee Oddling_Smee_et_al_2013 for modification of conditions by organisms.\n\n\n\n\nresources - risks\n\n“Is it worth the risk?” (Brown_and_Kotler_2004)\neg. predation risks causing organisms to avoid high resource density areas (McNammara_and_Houston_1987)\nSurviving individuals in areas of high risk will have lower resource competition which may lead to an increase in overall population fitness (Van_Leeuwen_et_al_2008)\n\nresources - conditions\n\nEnvironmental conditions influence on detection and intake of resources\neg. depth and sediment type on accessibility of marine invertebrates to predators (De_Goeij_and_Honkoop_2022)\n\nrisks - conditions\n\neg. detection risk of prey by predator given canopy cover (Brown_and_Koetler_2004)\n\nresources - risks - conditions\n\neg. warm blooded marine mammals in polar environments, balancing risk of hypothermia with prey resource under cold temperature conditions (Grady_et_al_2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation is at the outset of an analysis, define habitat as a point in environmental space whose dimensions are environmental variables (resources, risks, conditions). This habitat is aspatial and species agnostic but can be used to map onto geographic space and/or determine species specific associations.\n\nIs habitat a place or a set of circumstances?\n\nA region in space intuitively captures the environmental variables. However this perspective has methodological disadvantages: - requires space to be divided apriori into parts which presents challenges given nested spatial scales - scale depends on species’ mobility and perception - environment is dynamic, changing seasonally or abruptly given anthropogenic or natural drivers - models specific to one location can be challenging to use for predictions to new locations\n\nShould habitat comprise just conditions or also include resources and risks?\n\nFor distribution of moving animals, resource selection functions (Manly_et_al_2002) initially included only food selection, later also incorporated conditions and risks.\nAll three types of environmental variables (resources, risks and conditions) ultimately influence fitness and distribution. Complex interactions between them prevent considering them in total isolation. Therefore, the definition of habitat necessarily includes all three.\n\nIs habitat specific specific or independent?\n\nProblems with specific specific definitions of habitat:\n\nit is unknown apriori which environmental variables will be relevant to any focal species\nthe inferred relationship between species and habitat is not binary and models must allow for gradients of suitability\n\n\n\n\nA species-habitat association connects habitats to observations of a species (at the individual, group or population levels).\n\n\nHabitat-associated fitness is the contribution of each unit of habitat, X, to the populations long term log-rate of change. Partial fitness (Matthiopolous_et_al_2015) can be interpreted as the fitness of population living in an environment of entirely habitat X.\nMechanisms of habitat-associated fitness:\n\nsub-organismal\nlevel of physiological capabilities\nanatomy\nlife history strategies\n\n\n\n\nOrganisms experiencing low fitness must relocate or face demographic consequences. Relation involves movement of individuals, groups or populations. Their movement trajectories are an indication animals response to environments.\n\nmovements that are localized, sinuous indicate high resource availability\n\nThe density of species that cannot relocate will be affected by habitat-mediated survival and reproduction.\n\n\n\nDynamics modify the relationship between habitat and species density.\nSpatial variation in density:\n\ndoes not reflect short term (minute/hour/day) mechanisms\ndoes reflect accumulated effects of processes operating at longer time scales (year/generations)\n\n\n\n\nAssociations with fitness represent the fundamental niche of a species. The realized niche is represented by the eventual species distribution. The difference between these two are the dynamics represented by the associations between habitat and mechanisms of change in species distribution. Species distribution is not necessarily proportion to fitness.\n\n\n\n\nDynamic mechanisms shape the relationship between fitness and species distribution\n\nindividual level: relative use of habitats\npopulation level: demographic forces\n\n\n\nIt is important to consider and incorporate the underlying mechanisms or emergent, accessibility constraints shaping individual movement into models. Voluntary movement is made up of decision to leave, and where to go.\n\nStay or go, decision to leave.\n\nPatch departure rules, giving up times. See Charnov_1976, Brown_1988\nmarginal-value-theorem posits once an individual depletes local resources to a point where their intake is less than their average long term intake rate, they should leave the patch (Charnov_1976).\nActual/perceived long term intake rate may change due to environmental change or learning abilities. Animal often cannot instantaneously determine what local intake rate is, so they need to learn. Learning takes time and may lead to suboptimal decisions particularly if the environmental is unpredictable.\nSee Ollason_1980, Biernaskie_et_al_2009, Kamil_et_al_2019, Riotte_Lambert_et_al_2019\n\nWhere to go\n\nAnimal may move:\n\nrandomly, eg. isotropic or correlated random walks\ndirected movement based on\n\nsensory perception (Fagan_et_al_2013)\nspatial memory (Bracis_2017)\ninformation from conspecifics (Jesner_2018, Oliveira_Santos_2016, Merkle_2019)\n\n\nCognitive processes operate at several, widely different scales\n\n\n\nThe distribution of all organisms (vs behavioural selection) is shaped by demographic processes highly dependent on spatially heterogeneous environmental variables.\nIt is difficult to tease apart the contributions of demographic processes and animal mobility on distributions. Eg. selection bias of observations since animals tagged with eg. GPS trackers are alive in capture location and therefore demographic sorting has already taken place and we can only study their behavioural selection.\n\n\n\n\nOften we assume that high local density indicates that the local habitat is good for species. This is not necessarily the case, but if it is, the assumptions of the following null model can be used to related the intrinsic fitness of a habitat with species distribution.\n\n\nNull models are mathematical constructs derived from sets of assumptions that form the basis for discussion on a physical process. Eg.\n\nlogistic model of population dynamics\nmodel of perfect mixing in predator prey dynamics\nmarginal-value-theorem\nneutral theory of biodiversity\n\nFor species-habitat associations, there has historically been an implicit null model without explicit mathematical formulation or assumptions.\n\n\n\nAssumptions\n\nhighly mobile dispersal stage, all space is equally accessible to all of its propagules\ncompletely sessile reproductive stage, local density results from local habitat quality\nintrinsic population growth solely driven by habitat, with positive values everywhere\nlocal population growth declines with local density\nno interspecific competition\n\nSee the book for full derivation of these formulas\nSee Matthiopolous_et_al_2015 where population growth rate relates to fitness of a population\n\\(N_{s, t+1} = N_{s, t} exp(F_{0}(x) - b N_{s, t})\\)\n\n\\(N_{s, t+1}\\): local population density at t + 1\n\\(N_{s, t}\\): local population density at t\n\\(F_{0}(x)\\): intrinsic fitness value of habitat\n\\(b\\): attrition on population growth of an added individual\n\nWhere the population density is very small, growth rate is equal to the intrinsic growth rate.\nWhere the population density is at an equilibrium local density, attrition caused by density dependence annuls the benefits of habitat and the equilibrium distribution is proportional to intrinsic growth rate.\n\n\n\nBuilding on Fretwell_and_Lucas_1969 who consider the distribution of an ideal free species a purely behavioural phenomenon without demographic sorting.\nAssumptions\n\nindividuals are ideal, aware of the value of all patches and make rational ideal choices\nindividuals are free, they can select any patch and all individual are identical\n\nThe first individual will select the patch with the highest baseline suitability rate. By using this patch, the suitability with decrease. This is repeated for all individuals and eventually all patches will have equal suitability.\nSee the book for full derivation of these formulas\n\\(S(x, N_{s, t}) = B_{x} - f(N_{s, t})\\)\n\n\\(S\\): suitability of a given location\n\\(x\\): set of environmental variables\n\\(N_{s, t}\\): density\n\\(B_{x}\\): baseline suitability\n\\(f\\): growth rate/fitness\n\nMechanisms: interference and scramble competition (Krivan_et_al_2008)\nUnder the first assumption, the baseline suitability is approximately the intrinsic value of the habitat (at low density) and the suitability is approximately the fitness/growth rate.\nFor each population there will be a unique ideal free distribution M. Where fitness declines linearly with local population size and where the population size M is at carrying capacity, we can set the equation equal to 0 and solve.\n\\(N_{S}^{*} = F_{0} / b\\)\nThe relationship between density and habitat suitability or fitness is identical to that for the ideal life history organism when the total population size is at carrying capacity.\n\n\n\nData on intrinsic growth rate are difficult to collect and observe since they require small population sizes. At equilibrium, “bad” patches will have locally extinct populations. If a limiting resource driving fitness is depletable, the abundance and distribution will differ between low and high densities.\nAt earlier stages of population growth and resource depletion, the correlation between food distribution and growth rates delivers an informative species-habitat association. At equilibrium distribution, depletion distorts inferences. Equilibrium density of the consumer will yield no relationship with food density but a strong positive relationship with food production/replenishment/productivity.\n\n\n\n\nProportional relationships between distribution and density is violated by\n\nNon linear relationships\nEquilibrium never reached due to demography, mobility and changing environments\n\n\n\nObservations only capture occupancy/vacancy rather than continuous measures of suitability\nSpecies density and fitness can also be positively related eg. where increasing group size results in decreased predation risks, increases information transfer and services and allee effects (see Allee_1951, Stephens_and_Sutherland_1999).\n\n\n\nOrganisms are often encountered in poor quality habitats\n\ntransient state (Matthiopolous_et_al_2020)\nextinction debt where individuals are pushed to poor quality habitats, time lag as population declines\n\nZero niche paradox: viable animal populations in landscapes with no points of positive fitness.

    "text": "Giraldeau, L.A. and Caraco, T., 2000. Social foraging theory. Princeton University Press.\n\n\n\nSocial foraging differs from individual foraging theory in that it requires economic interdependence of payoffs and penalties. An individual’s foraging behaviour and its functional consequence depends on the actions of the individual and the behaviour of other foragers. The majority of this book’s attention is on consequences for individuals with some on communities.\nComparing individual foraging theory, eg. Stephens_and_Krebs_1986, to social foraging theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual foraging theory\nSocial foraging theory\n\n\n\n\nPrey selection strategy for an individual involves attack probabilities for different prey and net rate of intake\nAdded complexity of considering 2+ predators for a shared clump of prey\n\n\n\nSocial criterion: 2+ individuals concurrently influence each other’s gains and losses\nHistorically, social groups are defined as individuals that derive evolutionary advantages from the presence of others while aggregations do not. Genuine attraction between individuals vs merely statistical coincidence.\nThis obscures the similarities between animals with complex social structures and those without. Eg. lions (complex) and pigeons (simpler/loose) both have food available to an individual dependent on the number of foragers in the group. Regardless of however “social” they can both be modelled with a similar social foraging model.\nSocial foraging theory is not the study of the origin of foraging groups. Social foraging does not treat antipredatory and energetic benefits as competing causes. Both are integrated into the currency of fitness.\nApproaches to social foraging theory:\n\ncomparative method correlating ecological conditions to population/species attributes\noptimization techniques\n\ncriticisms: Cohen_1976, Launde_1982, Gray_1987, Hines_1987\nresponses: Maynard_Smith_1978, Oster_Wislson_1978, Mayr_1983, Krebs_Davies_1984, Stephens_Krebs_1986, Schoener_1987\n\n\nNash equilibrium is a set of strategies (one for each player) such that no player can improve its payoff by changing strategy vs the other Nash equilibrium strategies. Nash equilibriums are stable if unilateral deviation reduces payoff.\nAn evolutionary-stable-strategy maximizes a player’s expected payoff. Stability may imply dynamics resistant to invasion by a rare strategy, or the consequences for an individual deviating from the evolutionary-stable-strategy. All evolutionary-stable-strategy are Nash equilibriums.\n\nStrategies may be\n\ndirectly equivalent to alleles\nmodified by the environment\nPure strategies are where there is a single action\n\nPopulations may be\n\nfinite\ninfinite\n\nPlay may be\n\nrepeated or not (single round)\ninformed or uninformed where each player chooses their action without knowledge of the action other players will take\n\nGames\n\nSymmetric where there is competitive equivalence of players with the same payoffs and penalties. No phenotypic attributes of individuals.\nDiscrete where each action is from a discrete set\n\n\nThis complexity has theoretical significance. The authors’ recommendation is to focus on phenotype. Assume selection has enhanced learning capacity and individuals can efficiently vary behaviour across environmental and social conditions.\nBox 1.1 Classes of behaviours that may occur among social foragers\n\nSelfish behaviour (positive effect on individual and negative on relatives)\nCooperative behaviour\n\nGroup selected altruism\nUnconditional cooperation\n\nKin-directed altruism (negative or neutral effect on individual and positive effect on relatives)\nMutualism (positive effect on individual and relatives)\n\nConditional cooperation\n\nReciprocal altruism\nConditional mutualism\n\n\n\nSearching\n\nat least some group members attempt to find food\nothers may avoid the cost of searching\nactive foragers may focus on different resources\ntime to locate patch depends on the number of individuals searching and their interacting efficiencies\nfood searching is treated as stochastic\n\nDividing\n\nfood is actively shared, divided equally\nallocated asymmetrically according to eg. dominance status\n\nThree types of social foragers\n\nProducers: search environment for food\nScroungers: do not search directly. They attend to other forager’s clump discoveries and aggressively or stealthily sequester some food\nOpportunist: both search directly and obtain food at clumps located by producers or opportunists. They are assumed less efficient than producers and scroungers.\n\nInteractions between types of social foragers\n\nProducer vs producer: equilibrium group size under controlled group-entry\nProducer vs scrounger: require some number of producers, depends on the cost of scrounging\nProducer vs opportunist: this interaction is not maintained under symmetric competition (Pulliam_and_Caraco_1984). Greater dominance status for opportunists or more efficient searching by producers will favor one or the other type.\nOpportunist vs opportunist: information-sharing systems, equivalent to group size under free entry\nScrounger vs opportunist: can persist due to knowledge limitation"
