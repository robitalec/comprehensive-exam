Producing where there are wolves should be more risky and ravens should favor scrounging. Where there are wild boars, ravens should produce more than where there are wolves. Also consider age, dominance and affiliative relationships within species.\nPredation risk at the feeding site affects ravens’ decision whether or not to scrounge in competition for food. Scrounging was more common among wolves than with wild boars. Scrounging strategy was influenced by dominance. Displacing others was typically shown by dominants whereas stealing was typically shown by subordinates. Food sharing only occurred in ravens at different stages of pair bonding (social affiliation) indicated by mutual preening or resting in close proximity. Displacing was twice as profitable as stealing or sharing.\n\n\nNA\n2003\nHa, RR; Ha, JC\nAnimal Behaviour\nEffects Of Ecology And Prey Characteristics On The Use Of Alternative Social Foraging Tactics In Crows, Corvus Caurinus\nnorthwestern crows\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nNA\n2003\nCoolen, I; Giraldeau, LA\nAnimal Behaviour\nIncompatibility Between Antipredatory Vigilance And Scrounger Tactic In Nutmeg Mannikins, Lonchura Punctulata\nnutmeg mannikins\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nNA\n2003\nHamilton, IM; Dill, LM\nEcology\nGroup Foraging By A Kleptoparasitic Fish: A Strong Inference Test Of Social Foraging Models\nwestern buffalo breams\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nNA\n2004\nBarta, Z; Liker, A; Monus, F\nAnimal Behaviour\nThe Effects Of Predation Risk On The Use Of Social Foraging Tactics\ntree sparrows\nPasser montanus\nProducers, scroungers\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nPredation risk proxy by modifying the distance between shelter and a feeder\nNA\nNA\nExperimentally manipulated effect of predation risk on social foraging tactic use.\nIndividual used the scrounging foraging tactic more often when far from cover than close to it. Scrounging was more common in larger groups. Scrounging use in riskier places cannot be simply explained by an additional advantage in increasing antipredator vigilance because at the level of the group, there was no correlation between scrounging and scanning rate. Within groups, a negative correlation was found between scrounging and scanning rate. These results are more similar to Coolen_2001, Coolen_2003 rather than Ranta_1998. This alternatively may be due to scrounging being a risk averse strategy and due to scrounging being a favored strategy when energy levels are low.\n\n\nNA\n2004\nLendvai, AZ; Barta, Z; Liker, A; Bokony, V\nProceedings Of The Royal Society B-Biological Sciences\nThe Effect Of Energy Reserves On Social Foraging: Hungry Sparrows Scrounge More\nhouse sparrows\nPasser domesticus\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nsci-hub.st/http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10764-005-8855-9\n2005\nBicca-Marques, JC; Garber, PA\nInternational Journal Of Primatology\nUse Of Social And Ecological Information In Tamarin Foraging Decisions\nemperor and saddlleback tamarins\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nNA\n2005\nWu, GM; Giraldeau, LA\nBehavioral Ecology\nRisky Decisions: A Test Of Risk Sensitivity In Socially Foraging Flocks Of Lonchura Punctulata\nnutmeg mannikins\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nsci-hub.st/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.10.032\n2006\nLendvai, AZ; Liker, A; Barta, Z\nAnimal Behaviour\nThe Effects Of Energy Reserves And Dominance On The Use Of Social-Foraging Strategies In The House Sparrow\nhouse sparrows\nPasser domesticus\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nExperimental wind exposure to manipulate overnight energy expenditure of dominant and subordinate individuals\nNA\nMutual effects of social dominance and level of energy reserves on the use of social foraging strategies\nIn response to experimental treatment of wind exposure, dominants used scrounging more frequently while subordinates only had a moderate increase in scrounging\n\n\nNA\n2006\nBarrette, M; Giraldeau, LA\nAnimal Behaviour\nPrey Crypticity Reduces The Proportion Of Group Members Searching For Food\nnutmeg mannikins\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nNA\n2006\nBeauchamp, G\nEthology\nPhenotypic Correlates Of Scrounging Behavior In Zebra Finches: Role Of Foraging Efficiency And Dominance\nzebra finches\nTaeniopygia guttata\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nNA\n2007\nMorand-Ferron, J; Giraldeau, LA; Lefebvre, L\nBehavioral Ecology\nWild Carib Grackles Play A Producer-Scrounger Game\nCarib grackles\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nNA\n2007\nMcCormack, JE; Jablonski, PG; Brown, JL\nBehaviour\nProducer-Scrounger Roles And Joining Based On Dominance In A Free-Living Group Of Mexican Jays (Aphelocoma Ultramarina)\nMexican jays\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nNA\n2008\nKatsnelson, E; Motro, U; Feldman, MW; Lotem, A\nAnimal Behaviour\nEarly Experience Affects Producer-Scrounger Foraging Tendencies In The House Sparrow\nhouse sparrows\nPasser domesticus\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nNA\n2008\nMathot, KJ; Giraldeau, LA\nBehavioral Ecology\nIncreasing Vulnerability To Predation Increases Preference For The Scrounger Foraging Tactic\nzebra finches\nTaeniopygia guttata\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nPredation simulated by wing-loading manipulations, clipping primary flight feathers\nNA\nNA\nNA\nWing-loading manipulations were effective at increasing focal individuals’ perception of vulnerability to predation, they increased their total time allocated to vigilance whereas control individuals did not.

Scrounging is a variance-averse strategy and is less sensitive to changes in patch quality variance than average patch quality. Learning rule models are better tools, to handle complex situations and in their simplicity, to study and predict animal behaviour in frequency-dependent systems than the evolutionarily stable strategy approach.

In larger patch sizes fish have a reduced finder’s share and tend to scrounge more often. In smaller patch sizes fish rely on private information, solitary foraging. Payoffs were higher for fish that produced in all environmental conditions, likely due in part to consistent interindividual differences in foraging efficiency and body size\n\n\nNA\n2016\nDumke, M; Herberstein, ME; Schneider, JM\nProceedings Of The Royal Society B-Biological Sciences\nProducers And Scroungers: Feeding-Type Composition Changes With Group Size In A Socially Foraging Spider\ncrab spiders\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nsci-hub.st/http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12983-016-0180-y\n2016\nLee, YF; Kuo, YM; Chu, WC\nFrontiers In Zoology\nEnergy State Affects Exploratory Behavior Of Tree Sparrows In A Group Context Under Differential Food-Patch Distributions\ntree sparrows\nPasser montanus\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nTested that energy states will affect exploratory behaviour using tree sparrows in fasted and fed states exploring a novel space with hidden food in different patch distribution patterns.\nSparrows in fed and fasted states did not differ in feeding rates in either patch pattern.

    "text": "Influence of producer-scrounger dynamics on habitat selection given risks and conditions\nThe dynamic mechanism for habitat selection at the individual level is behavioural selection. It is comprised of patch departure rules or giving up rates and the decision where to go next. Habitats are defined in terms of resources, risks and conditions. Environmental variables corresponding to these three can have complex interactions.\nProducer-scrounger dynamics consider the payoffs and penalties of strategies given the density of conspecifics and their corresponding strategies. A strategy whose fitness cannot be improved given the current environment and set of conspecifics’ strategies or a strategy that resists the invasion of a rare alternative is an evolutionary stable strategy.\nRisks are integrated differently in producer-scrounger dynamics and habitat selection. Predation risk, for example, is directly incorporated into the penalty for each strategy in a producer-scrounger game. For habitat selection, predation risk would make up one of the relevant environmental variables under the risk category that define a habitat, with an expected negative relationship with fitness.\nHow are conditions considered for producer-scrounger dynamics other than extreme conditions that represent potential penalties?\nFor habitat selection, conditions form a subset of the environmental variables that make up a habitat.\nHow do producers and scroungers differ in their access to available resources?\n\nthis relates to ESSs for different densities and proportion of producers/scroungers\naccess for producers is high when density is low, because the number of available patches is high and they are more efficient than scroungers at searching for them\naccess for scroungers is low when density is low, because the overall number of producers is low and therefore low scrounging potential\naccess for producers is lower when density is high because unoccupied patches are lower\naccess for scroungers is higher when density is high because more producers have found more patches and scrounging potential is higher"

When scrounging is common, the number of individuals competing as scroungers increases and the payoffs for scroungers declines. Survival probability is the currency used here instead of net food intake to determine how the use of either strategy impacts individuals’ survival probability\nThe nighttime non foraging period reduces animal’s energy reserves that are replenished during daylight. Foraging increases risk of predation while resting decreases risk of predation while consuming energy\nNA\nNA\nPredation / hazard risk. Scroungers surveying for producers finding patches also provides a lower predation hazard as a by-product and to include this, the authors set the predation hazard for scroungers to half that of the producers.\nNA\nAll scroungers get equal access to each producer’s patch minus the producer’s share. Patch-finding rate and amount of food in a patch were constant. Varying patchiness did not change the average daily stable proportion of scrounging but increasing patchiness decreased the probability of survival in most cases.\nState-dependent dynamic producer-scrounger game that predicts early in the day when energy reserves are low, individuals will prefer the scrounger strategy. Late in the day, individuals will favor the producer strategy. Under rich and clumped food, scrounging will improve daily survival of all group members.\nThe proportion of individuals scrounging is predicted to change through the day, highest around dawn and dusk and lowest around midday because the scrounger obtains small amounts of food in a reliable way while the producer either acquires high or no food intake. Producing is optimal in midday if individuals are near or above their critical reserve level because if a producer is successful they are likely able to switch to resting sooner and avoid predation hazard.\n\n\n2000\nBeauchamp, G\nJournal Of Theoretical Biology\nLearning Rules For Social Foragers: Implications For The Producer-Scrounger Game And Ideal Free Distribution Theory\nProducers, scroungers\nNA\nNA\nMovement cost. Scroungers would move to the nearest exploited patch at a speed of two locations per time step instead of one since they were not limited by concurrently searching for food\nPatches were depletable\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nLearning rules for social foraging in the ideal free distribution and producer-scrounger dynamics\nScrounging is less likely in populations with fewer foragers and in habitats with poorer patches. Maximizing led to early divergence in tactic use and extreme use of one or the other tactic. When individuals had early foraging success, they were likely to continue using the same strategy. This could be problematic in highly variable environments or in situations where environments change significantly where an alternative strategy would otherwise be favored.\n\n\n2001\nBarta, Z; Giraldeau, LA\nBehavioral Ecology\nBreeding Colonies As Information Centers: A Reappraisal Of Information-Based Hypotheses Using The Producer-Scrounger Game\nProducers, scroungers representing searcher and wait-and-follower\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n2003\nDubois, F; Giraldeau, LA; Grant, JWA\nBehavioral Ecology\nResource Defense In A Group-Foraging Context\nProducers, scroungers representing searcher and wait-and-follower\nNA\nResources for scrounger are what remains minus finder’s share\nEnergetic costs of fighting\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nReconcile differences between optimality approach used to predict economic defendability of resources and game theoretic approach\nAggression should always decrease as the density and richness of food clumps increases.

The joining distance should increase with decreasing density of other foragers, increasing speed of movement, increasing difficulty in finding undiscovered food patches and decreasing speed of which discovered patches can be consumed. Discovered patches are more heavily exploited when patches are hard to find, patches can be searched for remaining food more quickly, forager density is low and foragers are relatively slow in traveling to discovered patches\n\n\n2005\nDubois, FD; Giraldeau, LA\nEcology\nFighting For Resources: The Economics Of Defense And Appropriation\nProducers, scroungers playing hawks, doves\nNA\nNA\nEnergetic cost of fight, mean contest duration, density of predators, risk of being killed by a predator during an escalated fight\nPatch density, patch richness\nNA\nPredation hazard\nNA\nNA\nHow changes in group size, clump density, patch richness and predation hazards affect both decision to appropriate and defend a resource and interact to predict effects on the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness of individuals\nProducer challenged by a scrounger should always aggressively defend clumps whereas only a fraction of scroungers should attempt to aggressively appropriate a producer’s food. This is due to the finders share that lets producers pay more for defense than a scrounger can for appropriation. Increasing group size will increase the rate of playing scrounger and increase the costs of aggression. Few scroungers are expected at the equilibrium when the number of foragers is small. Increasing patch density will reduce the time required for producers to find patches and the temporal costs associated with aggressive appropriation will make scrounger less profitable. Encounters will decline as the number of producers increases. Increasing patch richness will increase the scrounger’s share and the proportion of scroungers within the group. Scroungers are more likely to get required food to offset expenses of aggressive appropriation. Costs of aggression increase with predation pressure as the increased probability of being killed by a predator while engaged in a fight increase. Aggression should reduce when predation hazard increases but non-aggressive scroungers will be unsuccessful securing food from aggressive producers. Otherwise, scroungers are likely to switch to producing, reducing the proportion of scroungers and decreasing the number of challenges but with lower numbers of scroungers, the aggressiveness increases.\n\n\n2007\nDubois, F; Giraldeau, LA\nBehavioral Ecology And Sociobiology\nFood Sharing Among Retaliators: Sequential Arrivals And Information Asymmetries\nProducers, scroungers, retaliators playing hawk, dove, retaliator.

This model offers one of the most parsimonious and potentially general evolutionary accounts of the origin of non-aggressive resource sharing.

Strong effect of the relationship between resource holding potential and the value of resources on how much aggressive behaviour occurs in the population. This results in fights occurring mainly between strong individuals or between weak individuals. For example, if a weak individual is struggling to survive, it will attribute high value to the resource and fight where a strong individual will not defend.\n\n\n2014\nKane, A; Jackson, AL; Ogada, DL; Monadjem, A; McNally, L\nProceedings Of The Royal Society B-Biological Sciences\nVultures Acquire Information On Carcass Location From Scavenging Eagles\nProducers, scroungers\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nDetermine if there are interspecific producer scrounger dynamics between eagles and vultures.\nSocial information transfer can occur across species and ecosystem-based management is critical considering vulture populations suffering global declines\n\n\n2015\nBroom, M; Johanis, M; Rychtar, J\nJournal Of Mathematical Biology\nThe Effect Of Fight Cost Structure On Fighting Behaviour\nProducers, scroungers\nNA\nNA\nIndividual choose to invest an amount of energy into contests and level of investment of each individual determines probability it will win contest, and additional cost it has to bear.

Where costs of contests are high, or if joiner only has a small chance of winning the contest eg if the patch is easily defended, the producer should play hawk and the scrounger should play dove leaving the producer with the resource without contest. When the scrounger’s potential cost is small compared to the value of the food or if the scrounger’s change of winning is high, the scrounger will always fight.\n\n\n2016\nLee, AEG; Ounsley, JP; Coulson, T; Rowcliffe, JM; Cowlishaw, G\nProceedings Of The Royal Society B-Biological Sciences\nInformation Use And Resource Competition: An Integrative Framework\nProducers, scroungers\nNA\nFinder’s share\nNA\nIndividuals can search for resources alone or by using social information\nDepletion rate, distribution\nNA\nNA\nMonopolizability, social rank\nDeveloped a model to demonstrate how competition can facilitate or constrain an individual’s ability to use information when acquiring resources, considering resource distribution\nIncreasing the producer’s resource discovery rate reduced the relative cost of solitary foraging. If patches were easy to find and individuals were unable to monopolize resources, scrounging became less common. Under conditions of strong monopolization and intermediate discovery rates, higher levels of scrounging occurred. Two main predictions: 1 The effects of resource scarcity on social information use should depend on resource monopolizability. 2 The potential benefits of social dominance should be closely linked to social information use in uncertain environments. There are constrains that competition imposes on an individual’s ability to use social information to access resources. When resources are monopolizable, social information use may become exclusive to dominant individuals leading to a positive relationship between social rank and resource acquisition rate. Selection pressures on dominance will depend on multidimensional aspects of resources eg. scarcity, depletion rate and monopolizability\n\n\n2017\nToyokawa, W\nRoyal Society Open Science\nScrounging By Foragers Can Resolve The Paradox Of Enrichment\nProducers, scroungers\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nPredator population in which individuals play a producer scrounger game to analyse the stability of a coexisting equilibrium point in one prey system and non equilibrium dynamics in two prey system.\nSocial foraging can stabilize both one prey and two prey systems and resolve the paradox of enrichment when scrounging is prevalent in predators.

Scrounging in the top predator of a tritrophic food chain can stabilize interactions between the top predator, its prey and its prey’s prey. Presence of scroungers reduces the total amount of resource acquired by the group. Scrounging limits group size, impact on prey and ability of a predator to outcompete other species, promoting stability and species diversity. Higher growth rates of the resource require high scrounging frequencies to prevent instability on the system. Low growth rates allow coexistence only when the finder’s advantage is high and scrounging frequency is low. If encounter rate is high, scrounging will be rare. Scrounging will not stabilize population dynamics, food chains and competitor interactions under all cases. If scrounging is too prevalent, it can push the population to extinction. Other factors such as food abundance, variations in weather, predators and parasites may have stronger effects that can completely obscure the effects of scrounging.\n\n\n2020\nDubois, F; Richard-Dionne, E\nEcology And Evolution\nConsequences Of Multiple Simultaneous Opportunities To Exploit Others’ Efforts On Free Riding\nProducers and scroungers, scrounging only occurs in the top predator.

When food is clumped into few rich patches rather than dispersed into many poor patches, the number of scroungers should increase. When risk of predation is lower, producing is favoured. When the probability of finding patches decreases with increasing forager density, larger groups should have more scroungers. When the probability of finding patches increases with increasing forager density, larger groups should have less scroungers."

proportion of scroungers (Barta_1998) (Lee_2016)\nFinder’s share allows producers to always aggressively defend clumps (Dubois_2005)\n(also under Patch departure) A producer should leave a patch earlier than a scrounger if the producer has a finder’s share (Rita_1997)\n\nContests\n\nDifferences between individuals in valuing resources leads to fights mainly occuring between strong individuals or weak individuals (Broom_2014)\nConvex cost functions correspond to risk of injury or lost energy and concave cost functions correspond to time costs eg exposure of predation risk (Broom_2015)\n(also under Finder’s share) Producers should always defend clumps given their advantage already having the finder’s share (Dubois_2005)\n(also under Patch density) Where patches are dense, scrounging is disfavored because of the time invested in contests (Dubois_2005)\n\nAggression\n\nRate of aggression increases with group size (Caraco_1979)\nAggression should decrease as the density and richness of food clumps increases (Dubois_2003)\nCosts of aggression increase with increasing predation pressure and so the rate of aggression should decrease (Dubois_2005)\n\nPredation\n\n(also under Aggression) Costs of aggression increase with increasing predation pressure and so the rate of aggression should decrease (Dubois_2005)\nLower predation risk should lead to a decrease in scrounging (Dubois_2020)\n(also under Vigilance) Scroungers may provide antipredator vigilance and contribute to dilution effect (Ranta_1996) (Ranta_1998)\n\nSharing\n\nSome animals share food clumps without any overt aggression possibly due to iterated play among familiar players (Dubois_2003)\nWhen retaliator strategy is included, there is widespread sharing predicted in habitats clumped with intermediate richness (Dubois_2007)\nWhen information asymmetry between producers and scroungers is incorporated, conditions for sharing are more easily met (Dubois_2007)\nSharing should be more common when resource heterogeneity leads to increased scrounger uncertainty (Dubois_2007)\n\nVigilance\n\nIncreased group size leads to decreased average vigilance (Caraco_1979)\nScroungers may provide antipredator vigilance and contribute to dilution effect (Ranta_1996) (Ranta_1998)\n\nJoining distance\n\nJoining distance should increase with decreasing density of foragers, increasing speed of movement, increasing difficulty in finding undiscovered food patches and decreasing speed at which patches are consumed (Ruxton_2005)\n\nDepletability\n\nDiscovered patches are more heavily exploited when patches are hard to find (Ruxton_2005)\n\nDominance\n\nSimilar dominance, individuals should similarly play scrounger (Barta_1998)\nAsymmetrical dominance, dominant individuals should play scrounger more often (Barta_1998)\nDominance increases foraging efficiency and access to forage (Caraco_1979)\nDominant individuals prefer social foraging while subordinate individuals prefer solitary foraging (Caraco_1989) (Lee_2016)\nScrounging can be an exclusive strategy of dominant individuals depending on resource monopolizability (Lee_2016)\nIf patches are distributed in clumps, dominant individuals will be able to exploit most patches by following subordinates (Caraco_1989)\n\nTime of day\n\nAround dawn and dusk, individuals should play scrounger more often due to low energy reserves (Barta_2000)\nAround midday, individuals should play producer if they are near or above critical reserve level because if they are successful they can more quickly switch to resting and avoid predation hazard (Barta_2000)\n\nInterference\n\nInterference between individuals reduces average intake rate and increases variation in intake rate across foragers (Beauchamp_1997)\n\nGroup size\n\nAt larger group sizes, scrounging should be more likely and when there are few foragers, scrounging should be rare (Beauchamp_2000a) (Dubois_2005)\n(also under Patch finding rate) When probability of finding patches decreases with increasing group size, number of scroungers should increase (Dubois_2020)\n(also under Patch finding rate) When probability of finding patches increases with increasing group size, number of scroungers should decrease (Dubois_2020)\n\nPatch richness\n\nIn habitats with poorer patches, scrounging should be less likely (Beauchamp_2000a)\nIncreasing patch richness will increase scrounger’s share and the proportion of scroungers will increase (Dubois_2005)\n(also under Sharing) When retaliator strategy is included, there is widespread sharing predicted in habitats clumped with intermediate richness (Dubois_2007)\n(also under Patch distribution) If patches are distributed in rich, clumps, scrounging should increase (Dubois_2020)\n\nPatch density\n\nAt higher patch densities, the producer’s patch finding rate should increase (Dubois_2005)\nAt higher patch densities, the rate of scrounging should decrease as the temporal costs of contests makes scrounging less profitable (Dubois_2005)\n\nPatch distribution\n\n(also under Dominance) If patches are distributed in clumps, dominant individuals will be able to exploit most patches by following subordinates (Caraco_1989)\nIf patches are distributed in rich, clumps, scrounging should increase and if patches are evenly distributed, producing should increase (Dubois_2020) (Ohtsuka_2009)\n\nPatch finding rate\n\n(also under Patch density) At higher patch densities, the producer’s patch finding rate should decrease (Dubois_2005)\nWhen probability of finding patches decreases with increasing group size, number of scroungers should increase (Dubois_2020)\nWhen probability of finding patches increases with increasing group size, number of scroungers should decrease (Dubois_2020)\nDecreased patch finding rate reduces the costs of solitary foraging and scrounging is less common (Lee_2016)\nPatch finding rate strongly influences frequency of producers (Ohtsuka_2009)\nPatch finding rate increases with the number of producers (Rita_1997)\n\nPatch departure\n\nA producer should leave a patch earlier than a scrounger if the producer has a finder’s share (Rita_1997)\n\n\n\n\n\nProducer scrounger models\n\nProducer priority where scrounging reduces producer’s food intake but does not depend on the number of scroungers in the group (Caraco_1991)\nScramble competition where producer’s food intake decreases with the number of scroungers (Caraco_1991)\n\nLearning\n\nEarly success may lead to individuals not adapting strategy to changing environments (Beauchamp_2000a)\nLearning never evolves to fixation and at a stable equilibrium there is a mixture of fixed and learning players (Dubois_2010)\nSocial learning is favored when competition is weak (Smolla_2015)\nIf competition is strong, social learning is favored when resource quality is highly variable and there is low environmental turnover (Smolla_2015)\n\nInformation\n\nExtra information held by producers can be both beneficial and harmful (Broom_2016).\nInformation not available to scrounger in situations where resources are not immediately visible eg. concelead nests, or where contest occurs quickly after patch is discovered and before producer has time to evaluate it (Broom_2016)\nProducers should fight for resources when costs of contests are high or scrounger has a small change of winning the contest eg. if patch is easily defended (Broom_2016)\nWhen scrounger’s potential cost is small compared to the value of the patch or if the scrounger has a high change of winning, the scrounger should always fight (Broom_2016)\n\nRelatedness\n\nIncreased relatedness can lead producers to being more tolerant of scrounging relatives (Mathot_2010)\n\nPopulation\n\nScrounging can act as a population regulator by reducing population level foraging efficiency and intake rate and allowing larger population sizes of predators (Coolen_2007)\nSocial foraging can stabilize one prey and two prey systems when scrounging is prevalent in predators (Toyokawa_2017) (Vickery_2020)\nScrounging can lower the growth rate of a population (Toyokawa_2017)\nScrounging can allow prey resources to persist at higher densities than if scrounging was absent (Toyokawa_2017) (Vickery_2020)\nPresence of scroungers in a predator can reduce the total amount of resource acquired by the group (Vickery_2020)\nPresence of scroungers in a predator can limit group size (Vickery_2020)\nPresence of scroungers in a predator can limit a predator’s ability to outcompete other species promoting stability and species diversity (Vickery_2020)\nScrounging will not stability population dynamics, food chains and competitor interactions under all cases, if scrounging is too prevalent it can push the population to extinction - Other factors such as food abundance, variations in weather, predators and parasites may have stronger effects that can completely obscure the effects of scrounging on populations (Vickery_2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterspecific social

specialization\n\nStable dimorphic distribution of producers and scroungers (Aplin_2017)\nIndividuals likely to use both strategies (Ha_2003)\n\nSex\n\nFemales were more likely to scrounge (Aplin_2017)\nMales were more likely to produce (Aplin_2017)\nAir temperature, time of day, season (breeding vs nonbreeding), age or sex did not influence the probability of retaining prey (Ha_2003)\nFemales scrounged from males when pregnant (King_2009)\nDominant females scrounged from subordinate neighbors with whom they had a strong social affiliation (King_2009)\n\nAge\n\nAdults were more likely to produce (Aplin_2017)\nJuveniles were more likely to scrounge (Aplin_2017)\n(also under Sex) Air temperature, time of day, season (breeding vs nonbreeding), age or sex did not influence the probability of retaining prey (Ha_2003)\nNo effect of age (Teichroeb_2015)\n\nDominance\n\nMale dominants more likely to produce (Aplin_2017)\nDominants took the role of scrounger and subordinates the role of producer (Werdenich_2002)\nScrounging dominants were more likely to displace conspecifics while stealing was more likely for subordinates (Bugnyar_2002)\n(also under Sex) Dominant females scrounged from subordinate neighbors with whom they had a strong social affiliation (King_2009)\n(also under Environmental factors) Wind exposure as a proxy to manipulate overnight energy expenditure lead dominants to scrounge more often and subordinates only marginally increase scrounging (Lendvai_2004)\nDominant individuals obtained more food than subordinates (Teichroeb_2015)\nDominant individuals obtained a larger share when producing than scrounging, balancing predation risk with food acquisition (Teichroeb_2015)\nFinder’s share increased with dominance (Teichroeb_2015)\n\nSocial affiliation\n\nMating pairs may have contributed to male tolerance of female scroungers (Aplin_2017)\nScroungers had high network centrality (Aplin_2017)\nSharing observed when dyads of ravens were at different stages of pair bonding eg mutual preening (Bugnyar_2002)\n(also under Sex) Dominant females scrounged from subordinate neighbors with whom they had a strong social affiliation (King_2009)\n\nPredation risk\n\nScrounging was more common further from cover than close to it (Barta_2004)\nScrounging more common when interspecific competition for food with high predation risk individual (wolf) versus boar (Bugnyar_2002)\nWing load manipulation (by clipping primary flight feathers) as a proxy for perception of vulnerability to predation increased time vigilant (Mathot_2007)\nWing load manipulation as proxy for vulnerability to predation increased scrounging but cannot distinguish compatibility of scrounging and antipredator vigilance, or scrounging due to spatial position within a group (Mathot_2007)\n\nVigilance\n\nScrounging not simply explained by antipredator vigilance, alternatively may be due to scrounging being a variance-averse strategy or favored strategy when energy reserves are low (Barta_2004)\nNo compatibility between scrounging and antipredator vigilance (Coolen_2003)\n(also under Predation risk) Wing load manipulation (by clipping primary flight feathers) as a proxy for perception of vulnerability to predation increased time vigilant (Mathot_2007)\n(also under Predation risk) Wing load manipulation as proxy for vulnerability to predation increased scrounging but cannot distinguish compatibility of scrounging and antipredator vigilance, or scrounging due to spatial position within a group (Mathot_2007)\n\nResource availability\n\nAt low and intermediate resource availability, scrounging is not favored after a 30s finder’s share (Kok_2017)\nAt high resource availability, scrounging is favored up to 120s (Kok_2017)\n\nFinder’s share\n\n(also under Resource availability) At low and intermediate resource availability, scrounging is not favored after a 30s finder’s share (Kok_2017)\n(also under Resource availability) At high resource availability, scrounging is favored up to 120s (Kok_2017)\nFinder’s share decreases with patch size (Hansen_2016)\nFinder’s share decreased with forager density (Hirsch_2019)\n(also under Dominance) Finder’s share increased with dominance (Teichroeb_2015)\nFinder’s share decreased with increasing patch richness (Teichroeb_2015)\n\nHandling time\n\nPrey size and longer handling time resulted in higher likelihood of conspecific stealing (Ha_2003)\n\nEnvironmental factors\n\n(also under Sex) Air temperature, time of day, season (breeding vs nonbreeding), age or sex did not influence the probability of retaining prey (Ha_2003)\nWind exposure as a proxy to manipulate overnight energy expenditure lead dominants to scrounge more often and subordinates only marginally increase scrounging (Lendvai_2004)\n\nEnergy reserves / fed or fasted\n\nRates of strategy use did not differ depending on fed and fasted states in sparrows (Lee_2016a)\nFasted sparrows stayed longer on the ground (Lee_2016a)\nFasted sparrows discovered more patches and consumed more food than fed sparrows (Lee_2016a)\n(also under Vigilance) Scrounging not simply explained by antipredator vigilance, alternatively may be due to scrounging being a variance-averse strategy or favored strategy when energy reserves are low

scrounging as it is less sensitive to patch quality variance (Afshar_2015)\n(also under Vigilance) Scrounging not simply explained by antipredator vigilance, alternatively may be due to scrounging being a variance-averse strategy or favored strategy when energy reserves are low (Barta_2004)\n\nArrival time on patch\n\nIndividuals that arrived earlier on the patch were less likely to scrounge (Aplin_2017)\n\n\nPayoffs\n\nPayoffs were higher for producers in all environmental conditions, likely due to body size and foraging efficiency (Hansen_2016)\n\nGroup formation\n\nBy being attracted to producers, scroungers induce group formation (Belisle_1998)"

Concerned with the functional advantage of sociality. Assume all individuals search independently while simultaneously observing each other. When a patch is found, all individuals feed on it. This assumption if called complete compatibility.\nUnlike [information-sharing-models], producer-scrounger models do not assume all group members behave in the same way. Some individuals specialize in producing and others in scrounging. At a given play of the game, a producer cannot scrounger and a scrounger cannot produce. This assumption is called complete incompatibility.\nThese two extremes are likely unrealistic with partial compatibility being more likely.

The remainder is divided equally between the producer and all scroungers (including opportunists), where the total consumed by scroungers is the scrounger’s share.\nSolitary foraging could be a solution for producers to avoid sharing with scroungers. This may not be possible when food is localized and presence of others cannot be escaped. Trade off of others balanced with predation risk.\n\n\n\nReconcile information-sharing and producer-scrounger models of group foraging\n\n\n\nThese three strategies can only coexist when opportunist’s loss in searching ability is exactly equal to its gain in scrounging ability. All pairs of strategies can coexist, depending on relative producing ability and relative scrounging ability of opportunists and the finder’s share."

Presence of scroungers reduces the total amount of resource acquired by the group. Scrounging limits group size, impact on prey and ability of a predator to outcompete other species, promoting stability and species diversity.\nHigher growth rates of the resource require high scrounging frequencies to prevent instability on the system. Low growth rates allow coexistence only when the finder’s advantage is high and scrounging frequency is low. If encounter rate is high, scrounging will be rare.\nScrounging will not stabilize population dynamics, food chains and competitor interactions under all cases.

These models were static and state independent and could not explore whether time of day, animal’s state and degree of predation hazard influenced individual decisions to use either strategy\nNext steps: incorporate dominance asymmetries and allow foragers the choice to forage alone\n\n\nProducer, scrounger\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen scrounging is rare, it is assumed to do better than the producer alternative because it can take advantage of the many exploitable food patches discovered by the producers. When scrounging is common, the number of individuals competing as scroungers increases and the payoffs for scroungers declines.\nSurvival probability is the currency used here instead of net food intake to determine how the use of either strategy impacts individuals’ survival probability\n\n\n\nThe nighttime non foraging period reduces animal’s energy reserves that are replenished during daylight. Foraging increases risk of predation while resting decreases risk of predation while consuming energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredation / hazard risk. Scroungers surveying for producers finding patches also provides a lower predation hazard as a by-product and to include this, the authors set the predation hazard for scroungers to half that of the producers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll scroungers get equal access to each producer’s patch minus the producer’s share. Patch-finding rate and amount of food in a patch were constant. Varying patchiness did not change the average daily stable proportion of scrounging but increasing patchiness decreased the probability of survival in most cases.\n\n\n\nState-dependent dynamic producer-scrounger game that predicts early in the day when energy reserves are low, individuals will prefer the scrounger strategy. Late in the day, individuals will favor the producer strategy. Under rich and clumped food, scrounging will improve daily survival of all group members.\n\n\n\nThe proportion of individuals scrounging is predicted to change through the day, highest around dawn and dusk and lowest around midday because the scrounger obtains small amounts of food in a reliable way while the producer either acquires high or no food intake. Producing is optimal in midday if individuals are near or above their critical reserve level because if a producer is successful they are likely able to switch to resting sooner and avoid predation hazard."

This is due to the finders_share that lets producers pay more for defense than a scrounger can for appropriation.\nIncreasing group size will increase the rate of playing scrounger and increase the costs of aggression. Few scroungers are expected at the equilibrium when the number of foragers is small.\nIncreasing patch density will reduce the time required for producers to find patches and the temporal costs associated with aggressive appropriation will make scrounger less profitable. Encounters will decline as the number of producers increases.\nIncreasing patch richness will increase the scrounger’s share and the proportion of scroungers within the group. Scroungers are more likely to get required food to offset expenses of aggressive appropriation.\nCosts of aggression increase with predation pressure as the increased probability of being killed by a predator while engaged in a fight increase. Aggression should reduce when predation hazard increases but non-aggressive scroungers will be unsuccessful securing food from aggressive producers. Otherwise, scroungers are likely to switch to producing, reducing the proportion of scroungers and decreasing the number of challenges but with lower numbers of scroungers, the aggressiveness increases."

Perception of risk may be just as influential, see Landre_et_al_2010.\nPresence of risks may limit actual presence of species, eg. where hosts are missing where parasites exist.\nrisks are often dynamic processes that are difficult to quantify. See Palmer_et_al_2017.\n\n\n\nconditions are environmental variables that surround the organism and influence its functioning.\n\nambient temperature\nsalinity\nhumidity\n\nconditions can have positive, negative or ambivalent effects on fitness. Eg. outside of limits of ambient temperature, organisms can die or stop functioning properly.\nSee Oddling_Smee_et_al_2013 for modification of conditions by organisms.\n\n\n\n\nresources - risks\n\n“Is it worth the risk?” (Brown_and_Kotler_2004)\neg. predation risks causing organisms to avoid high resource density areas (McNammara_and_Houston_1987)\nSurviving individuals in areas of high risk will have lower resource competition which may lead to an increase in overall population fitness (Van_Leeuwen_et_al_2008)\n\nresources - conditions\n\nEnvironmental conditions influence on detection and intake of resources\neg. depth and sediment type on accessibility of marine invertebrates to predators (De_Goeij_and_Honkoop_2022)\n\nrisks - conditions\n\neg. detection risk of prey by predator given canopy cover (Brown_and_Koetler_2004)\n\nresources - risks - conditions\n\neg. warm blooded marine mammals in polar environments, balancing risk of hypothermia with prey resource under cold temperature conditions (Grady_et_al_2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation is at the outset of an analysis, define habitat as a point in environmental space whose dimensions are environmental variables (resources, risks, conditions). This habitat is aspatial and species agnostic but can be used to map onto geographic space and/or determine species specific associations.\n\nIs habitat a place or a set of circumstances?\n\nA region in space intuitively captures the environmental variables. However this perspective has methodological disadvantages: - requires space to be divided apriori into parts which presents challenges given nested spatial scales - scale depends on species’ mobility and perception - environment is dynamic, changing seasonally or abruptly given anthropogenic or natural drivers - models specific to one location can be challenging to use for predictions to new locations\n\nShould habitat comprise just conditions or also include resources and risks?\n\nFor distribution of moving animals, resource selection functions (Manly_et_al_2002) initially included only food selection, later also incorporated conditions and risks.\nAll three types of environmental variables (resources, risks and conditions) ultimately influence fitness and distribution. Complex interactions between them prevent considering them in total isolation. Therefore, the definition of habitat necessarily includes all three.\n\nIs habitat specific specific or independent?\n\nProblems with specific specific definitions of habitat:\n\nit is unknown apriori which environmental variables will be relevant to any focal species\nthe inferred relationship between species and habitat is not binary and models must allow for gradients of suitability\n\n\n\n\nA species-habitat association connects habitats to observations of a species (at the individual, group or population levels).\n\n\nHabitat-associated fitness is the contribution of each unit of habitat, X, to the populations long term log-rate of change. Partial fitness (Matthiopolous_et_al_2015) can be interpreted as the fitness of population living in an environment of entirely habitat X.\nMechanisms of habitat-associated fitness:\n\nsub-organismal\nlevel of physiological capabilities\nanatomy\nlife history strategies\n\n\n\n\nOrganisms experiencing low fitness must relocate or face demographic consequences. Relation involves movement of individuals, groups or populations. Their movement trajectories are an indication animals response to environments.\n\nmovements that are localized, sinuous indicate high resource availability\n\nThe density of species that cannot relocate will be affected by habitat-mediated survival and reproduction.\n\n\n\nDynamics modify the relationship between habitat and species density.\nSpatial variation in density:\n\ndoes not reflect short term (minute/hour/day) mechanisms\ndoes reflect accumulated effects of processes operating at longer time scales (year/generations)\n\n\n\n\nAssociations with fitness represent the fundamental niche of a species. The realized niche is represented by the eventual species distribution. The difference between these two are the dynamics represented by the associations between habitat and mechanisms of change in species distribution. Species distribution is not necessarily proportion to fitness.\n\n\n\n\nDynamic mechanisms shape the relationship between fitness and species distribution\n\nindividual level: relative use of habitats\npopulation level: demographic forces\n\n\n\nIt is important to consider and incorporate the underlying mechanisms or emergent, accessibility constraints shaping individual movement into models. Voluntary movement is made up of decision to leave, and where to go.\n\nStay or go, decision to leave.\n\nPatch departure rules, giving up times. See Charnov_1976, Brown_1988\nmarginal-value-theorem posits once an individual depletes local resources to a point where their intake is less than their average long term intake rate, they should leave the patch (Charnov_1976).\nActual/perceived long term intake rate may change due to environmental change or learning abilities. Animal often cannot instantaneously determine what local intake rate is, so they need to learn. Learning takes time and may lead to suboptimal decisions particularly if the environmental is unpredictable.\nSee Ollason_1980, Biernaskie_et_al_2009, Kamil_et_al_2019, Riotte_Lambert_et_al_2019\n\nWhere to go\n\nAnimal may move:\n\nrandomly, eg. isotropic or correlated random walks\ndirected movement based on\n\nsensory perception (Fagan_et_al_2013)\nspatial memory (Bracis_2017)\ninformation from conspecifics (Jesner_2018, Oliveira_Santos_2016, Merkle_2019)\n\n\nCognitive processes operate at several, widely different scales\n\n\n\nThe distribution of all organisms (vs behavioural selection) is shaped by demographic processes highly dependent on spatially heterogeneous environmental variables.\nIt is difficult to tease apart the contributions of demographic processes and animal mobility on distributions. Eg. selection bias of observations since animals tagged with eg. GPS trackers are alive in capture location and therefore demographic sorting has already taken place and we can only study their behavioural selection.\n\n\n\n\nOften we assume that high local density indicates that the local habitat is good for species. This is not necessarily the case, but if it is, the assumptions of the following null model can be used to related the intrinsic fitness of a habitat with species distribution.\n\n\nNull models are mathematical constructs derived from sets of assumptions that form the basis for discussion on a physical process. Eg.\n\nlogistic model of population dynamics\nmodel of perfect mixing in predator prey dynamics\nmarginal-value-theorem\nneutral theory of biodiversity\n\nFor species-habitat associations, there has historically been an implicit null model without explicit mathematical formulation or assumptions.\n\n\n\nAssumptions\n\nhighly mobile dispersal stage, all space is equally accessible to all of its propagules\ncompletely sessile reproductive stage, local density results from local habitat quality\nintrinsic population growth solely driven by habitat, with positive values everywhere\nlocal population growth declines with local density\nno interspecific competition\n\nSee the book for full derivation of these formulas\nSee Matthiopolous_et_al_2015 where population growth rate relates to fitness of a population\n\\(N_{s, t+1} = N_{s, t} exp(F_{0}(x) - b N_{s, t})\\)\n\n\\(N_{s, t+1}\\): local population density at t + 1\n\\(N_{s, t}\\): local population density at t\n\\(F_{0}(x)\\): intrinsic fitness value of habitat\n\\(b\\): attrition on population growth of an added individual\n\nWhere the population density is very small, growth rate is equal to the intrinsic growth rate.\nWhere the population density is at an equilibrium local density, attrition caused by density dependence annuls the benefits of habitat and the equilibrium distribution is proportional to intrinsic growth rate.\n\n\n\nBuilding on Fretwell_and_Lucas_1969 who consider the distribution of an ideal free species a purely behavioural phenomenon without demographic sorting.\nAssumptions\n\nindividuals are ideal, aware of the value of all patches and make rational ideal choices\nindividuals are free, they can select any patch and all individual are identical\n\nThe first individual will select the patch with the highest baseline suitability rate. By using this patch, the suitability with decrease. This is repeated for all individuals and eventually all patches will have equal suitability.\nSee the book for full derivation of these formulas\n\\(S(x, N_{s, t}) = B_{x} - f(N_{s, t})\\)\n\n\\(S\\): suitability of a given location\n\\(x\\): set of environmental variables\n\\(N_{s, t}\\): density\n\\(B_{x}\\): baseline suitability\n\\(f\\): growth rate/fitness\n\nMechanisms: interference and scramble-competition (Krivan_et_al_2008)\nUnder the first assumption, the baseline suitability is approximately the intrinsic value of the habitat (at low density) and the suitability is approximately the fitness/growth rate.\nFor each population there will be a unique ideal-free-distribution M. Where fitness declines linearly with local population size and where the population size M is at carrying capacity, we can set the equation equal to 0 and solve.\n\\(N_{S}^{*} = F_{0} / b\\)\nThe relationship between density and habitat suitability or fitness is identical to that for the ideal life history organism when the total population size is at carrying capacity.\n\n\n\nData on intrinsic growth rate are difficult to collect and observe since they require small population sizes. At equilibrium, “bad” patches will have locally extinct populations. If a limiting resource driving fitness is depletable, the abundance and distribution will differ between low and high densities.\nAt earlier stages of population growth and resource depletion, the correlation between food distribution and growth rates delivers an informative species-habitat association. At equilibrium distribution, depletion distorts inferences. Equilibrium density of the consumer will yield no relationship with food density but a strong positive relationship with food production/replenishment/productivity.\n\n\n\n\nProportional relationships between distribution and density is violated by\n\nNon linear relationships\nEquilibrium never reached due to demography, mobility and changing environments\n\n\n\nObservations only capture occupancy/vacancy rather than continuous measures of suitability\nSpecies density and fitness can also be positively related eg. where increasing group size results in decreased predation risks, increases information transfer and services and allee effects (see Allee_1951, Stephens_and_Sutherland_1999).\n\n\n\nOrganisms are often encountered in poor quality habitats\n\ntransient state (Matthiopolous_et_al_2020)\nextinction debt where individuals are pushed to poor quality habitats, time lag as population declines\n\nZero niche paradox: viable animal populations in landscapes with no points of positive fitness. This can occur due to transient resources or conditions, or movement to enture overall positive fitness considering resources, risks and conditions.\n\n\n\n\nColonization credit (Watts_et_al_2020)\nMismatches may be due to imperfect information or dynamic environments\nSite fidelity (Matthiopolous_et_al_2005)\nEltonian viewpoint (Soberon_2007)\nLandscapes of fear\n\n\n\n\n\nKey desire to assume: pseudo equilibrium assumption where presence is suitable and absence is unsuitable.\nGuisan_and_Huiller_2005 Gallion_et_al_2012\nMechanisms that violate null models:\n\nspecies abundance not consistently indicative of habitat suitability gradients\nspecies survive in areas of negative fitness\nextinction debts\ncolonization credits\n\nSo far, species distribution models inferences are only valid under the assumptions of the null model.

An individual’s foraging behaviour and its functional consequence depends on the actions of the individual and the behaviour of other foragers.

Stephens_and_Krebs_1986, to social foraging theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual foraging theory\nSocial foraging theory\n\n\n\n\nPrey selection strategy for an individual involves attack probabilities for different prey and net rate of intake\nAdded complexity of considering 2+ predators for a shared clump of prey\n\n\n\nSocial criterion: 2+ individuals concurrently influence each other’s gains and losses\nHistorically, social groups are defined as individuals that derive evolutionary advantages from the presence of others while aggregations do not. Genuine attraction between individuals vs merely statistical coincidence.\nThis obscures the similarities between animals with complex social structures and those without. Eg. lions (complex) and pigeons (simpler/loose) both have food available to an individual dependent on the number of foragers in the group. Regardless of however “social” they can both be modelled with a similar social foraging model.\nSocial foraging theory is not the study of the origin of foraging groups. Social foraging does not treat antipredatory and energetic benefits as competing causes. Both are integrated into the currency of fitness.\nApproaches to social foraging theory:\n\ncomparative method correlating ecological conditions to population/species attributes\noptimization techniques\n\ncriticisms: Cohen_1976, Launde_1982, Gray_1987, Hines_1987\nresponses: Maynard_Smith_1978, Oster_Wislson_1978, Mayr_1983, Krebs_Davies_1984, Stephens_Krebs_1986, Schoener_1987\n\n\nNash equilibrium is a set of strategies (one for each player) such that no player can improve its payoff by changing strategy vs the other Nash equilibrium strategies. Nash equilibriums are stable if unilateral deviation reduces payoff.\nAn evolutionary-stable-strategy maximizes a player’s expected payoff. Stability may imply dynamics resistant to invasion by a rare strategy, or the consequences for an individual deviating from the evolutionary-stable-strategy.

No phenotypic attributes of individuals.\nDiscrete where each action is from a discrete set\n\n\nThis complexity has theoretical significance. The authors’ recommendation is to focus on phenotype. Assume selection has enhanced learning capacity and individuals can efficiently vary behaviour across environmental and social conditions.\nBox 1.1 Classes of behaviours that may occur among social foragers\n\nSelfish behaviour (positive effect on individual and negative on relatives)\nCooperative behaviour\n\nGroup selected altruism\nUnconditional cooperation\n\nKin-directed altruism (negative or neutral effect on individual and positive effect on relatives)\nMutualism (positive effect on individual and relatives)\n\nConditional cooperation\n\nReciprocal altruism\nConditional mutualism\n\n\n\nSearching\n\nat least some group members attempt to find food\nothers may avoid the cost of searching\nactive foragers may focus on different resources\ntime to locate patch depends on the number of individuals searching and their interacting efficiencies\nfood searching is treated as stochastic\n\nDividing\n\nfood is actively shared, divided equally\nallocated asymmetrically according to eg. dominance status\n\nThree types of social foragers\n\nProducers: search environment for food\nScroungers: do not search directly. They attend to other forager’s clump discoveries and aggressively or stealthily sequester some food\nOpportunist: both search directly and obtain food at clumps located by producers or opportunists. They are assumed less efficient than producers and scroungers.\n\nInteractions between types of social foragers\n\nProducer vs producer: equilibrium group size under controlled group-entry\nProducer vs scrounger: require some number of producers, depends on the cost of scrounging\nProducer vs opportunist: this interaction is not maintained under symmetric competition (Pulliam_and_Caraco_1984). Greater dominance status for opportunists or more efficient searching by producers will favor one or the other type.\nOpportunist vs opportunist: information-sharing systems, equivalent to group size under free entry\nScrounger vs opportunist: can persist due to knowledge limitation"
