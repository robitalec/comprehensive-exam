    "text": "Foraging for resources depends on the behaviour of conspecifics. Early individual foraging theory often focused on forage selection, net rate of intake, and effort or quitting time (Stephens and Krebs 1986; Stephens, Brown, and Ydenberg 2007). Social foraging theory considers the interdependence between a forager’s strategy and that of their conspecifics [Giraldeau and Caraco (2000); Box 1]. The complexity of multiple individuals foraging from a common patch requires attention to both the density of individuals and the frequency of strategies among them (Barnard and Sibly 1981; Vickery et al. 1991; Giraldeau and Caraco 2000). Social foraging theory considers a minimum criterion for sociality where animals are considered social if their benefits and costs are interdependent (Giraldeau and Caraco 2000). Producer-scrounger dynamics are a type of social foraging model that considers two types of foraging behaviours Vickery et al. (1991). Producers are animals that independently search for forage patches. Scroungers follow conspecific producers to share or steal from their discovered patches. The frequency of each strategy in a group or population changes its profitability. When producers are rare, scrounging is less favorable since less patches are being discovered. When scroungers are common, producers have to divide their patches among more conspecifics patches (Vickery et al. 1991; Giraldeau and Caraco 2000; Dubois and Giraldeau 2005). Notably, the accessibility of resources is different depending on the foraging strategy where scroungers only have access to patches made available to them by producers.\nDetermining the subset of available habitat that is accessible to animals has been a methodological focus of habitat selection analyses (Beyer et al. 2010; Northrup et al. 2013; Matthiopoulos et al. 2020). Part of this focus is due to the inherent requirement for a definition of availability to calculation selection. Preferential selection of a habitat by an animal is defined as the disproportionate use given the availability. If the measurement of available habitat is inaccurate, the measure of selection will be inaccurate (CITE). Advances in theory and computational power have offered a refined measure of availability that is constrained to variables related to animal’s movement patterns (Thurfjell, Ciuti, and Boyce 2014). Given these, habitat selection analyses help discern the relationship between animal’s movement and their selection or avoidance for particular habitats (Matthiopoulos, Fieberg, and Aarts 2023, Box 2).\nA habitat is defined as a combination of environmental variables categorized as resources, risks and conditions [Aarts et al. (2008); Matthiopoulos, Fieberg, and Aarts (2023); Box 2]. Resources are variables that provide a benefit to an animal including forage, mating opportunities, resting sites, and nesting sites. Risks are variables that can have a negative influence on survival or contribute to perceived risk including predation, anthropogenic disturbance or harvest, and parasites. Conditions are variables that often have negative effects when they are extreme but neutral effects at average levels including temperature, humidity, salinity, and wind speed. Resources, risks and conditions influence species distributions and individual behavioural selection of habitats (Matthiopoulos, Fieberg, and Aarts 2023). \nThe goals of this manuscript are to address the following: 1) how is access to available resources related dependent on role in producer-scrounger dynamics?, 2) how are foraging strategies influenced by resources, risks and conditions, and 3) how can the concept of availability during habitat selection be extended by consider producer-scrounger dynamics? To address these, I will review the producer-scrounger dynamics literature (see details in Supplement: Methods) to identify variables influencing access and availability of resources, and tests of the influence of risks and conditions on foraging strategy use. Finally, I will bridge the social foraging theory into habitat selection analyses by proposing a novel integration of availability using foraging strategy (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAarts, Geert, Monique MacKenzie, Bernie McConnell, Mike Fedak, and Jason Matthiopoulos. 2008. “Estimating Space-Use and Habitat Preference from Wildlife Telemetry Data.” Ecography 31 (1): 140–60. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0906-7590.05236.x.\n\n\nBarnard, C.

    "text": "Figure S1\nFigure S1: Graph visualization of all variables directly and indirectly related to producer-scrounger dynamics identified in the reviewed literature (Table S1). The color of the lines indicates the nature of the relationship: blue indicates a positive relationship, red indicates a negative relationship, black indicates a neutral relationship, orange indicates a convex relationship and grey indicates subcategories. For example, dominance has a positive relationship on forage access (Caraco 1979), patch richness has a negative relationship with rate of aggression (Dubois 2003), proportion of scroungers has a neutral relationship with antipredator vigilance (Mathot 2007), time of day has a convex relationship with proportion of scroungers (Barta 2000), and juveniles and adults are subcategories of age. Linetypes indicate the approach of the study that contributed this relationship where solid lines are producer-scrounger models using evolutionary game theory and dashed lines are empirical tests. For example, the relationship between patch richness and rate of aggression was contributed by an evolutionary game theory model (Dubois 2003) and the relationship between proportion of scroungers and antipredator vigilance was contributed by an empirical test (Mathot 2007). Note that multiple lines may be drawn between the same pair of variables and when they are differently colored it indicates a disagreement in the reviewed articles. Citations for multiple articles that contributed the same approach (linetype) and nature of relationship (color) are combined in a list. Citations are always found above the line between the two variables. The graph visualization was built using GraphViz (Gansner and North 2000)."

    "text": "Strategies\n\nProducers, scroungers\nRetaliators where finder can retaliate if joiner escalates (Dubois_2007)\n\nFinder’s share\n\nIncrease finder’s share leads to a decrease in proportion of scroungers (Barta_1998) (Lee_2016)\nFinder’s share allows producers to always aggressively defend clumps (Dubois_2005)\n(also under Patch departure) A producer should leave a patch earlier than a scrounger if the producer has a finder’s share (Rita_1997)\n\nContests\n\nDifferences between individuals in valuing resources leads to fights mainly occuring between strong individuals or weak individuals (Broom_2014)\nConvex cost functions correspond to risk of injury or lost energy and concave cost functions correspond to time costs eg exposure of predation risk (Broom_2015)\n(also under Finder’s share) Producers should always defend clumps given their advantage already having the finder’s share (Dubois_2005)\n(also under Patch density) Where patches are dense, scrounging is disfavored because of the time invested in contests (Dubois_2005)\n\nAggression\n\nRate of aggression increases with group size (Caraco_1979)\nAggression should decrease as the density and richness of food clumps increases (Dubois_2003)\nCosts of aggression increase with increasing predation pressure and so the rate of aggression should decrease (Dubois_2005)\n\nPredation\n\n(also under Aggression) Costs of aggression increase with increasing predation pressure and so the rate of aggression should decrease (Dubois_2005)\nLower predation risk should lead to a decrease in scrounging (Dubois_2020)\n(also under Vigilance) Scroungers may provide antipredator vigilance and contribute to dilution effect (Ranta_1996) (Ranta_1998)\n\nSharing\n\nSome animals share food clumps without any overt aggression possibly due to iterated play among familiar players (Dubois_2003)\nWhen retaliator strategy is included, there is widespread sharing predicted in habitats clumped with intermediate richness (Dubois_2007)\nWhen information asymmetry between producers and scroungers is incorporated, conditions for sharing are more easily met (Dubois_2007)\nSharing should be more common when resource heterogeneity leads to increased scrounger uncertainty (Dubois_2007)\n\nVigilance\n\nIncreased group size leads to decreased average vigilance (Caraco_1979)\nScroungers may provide antipredator vigilance and contribute to dilution effect (Ranta_1996) (Ranta_1998)\n\nJoining distance\n\nJoining distance should increase with decreasing density of foragers, increasing speed of movement, increasing difficulty in finding undiscovered food patches and decreasing speed at which patches are consumed (Ruxton_2005)\n\nDepletability\n\nDiscovered patches are more heavily exploited when patches are hard to find (Ruxton_2005)\n\nDominance\n\nSimilar dominance, individuals should similarly play scrounger (Barta_1998)\nAsymmetrical dominance, dominant individuals should play scrounger more often (Barta_1998)\nDominance increases foraging efficiency and access to forage (Caraco_1979)\nDominant individuals prefer social foraging while subordinate individuals prefer solitary foraging (Caraco_1989) (Lee_2016)\nScrounging can be an exclusive strategy of dominant individuals depending on resource monopolizability (Lee_2016)\nIf patches are distributed in clumps, dominant individuals will be able to exploit most patches by following subordinates (Caraco_1989)\n\nTime of day\n\nAround dawn and dusk, individuals should play scrounger more often due to low energy reserves (Barta_2000)\nAround midday, individuals should play producer if they are near or above critical reserve level because if they are successful they can more quickly switch to resting and avoid predation hazard (Barta_2000)\n\nInterference\n\nInterference between individuals reduces average intake rate and increases variation in intake rate across foragers (Beauchamp_1997)\n\nGroup size\n\nAt larger group sizes, scrounging should be more likely and when there are few foragers, scrounging should be rare (Beauchamp_2000a) (Dubois_2005)\n(also under Patch finding rate) When probability of finding patches decreases with increasing group size, number of scroungers should increase (Dubois_2020)\n(also under Patch finding rate) When probability of finding patches increases with increasing group size, number of scroungers should decrease (Dubois_2020)\n\nPatch richness\n\nIn habitats with poorer patches, scrounging should be less likely (Beauchamp_2000a)\nIncreasing patch richness will increase scrounger’s share and the proportion of scroungers will increase (Dubois_2005)\n(also under Sharing) When retaliator strategy is included, there is widespread sharing predicted in habitats clumped with intermediate richness (Dubois_2007)\n(also under Patch distribution) If patches are distributed in rich, clumps, scrounging should increase (Dubois_2020)\n\nPatch density\n\nAt higher patch densities, the producer’s patch finding rate should increase (Dubois_2005)\nAt higher patch densities, the rate of scrounging should decrease as the temporal costs of contests makes scrounging less profitable (Dubois_2005)\n\nPatch distribution\n\n(also under Dominance) If patches are distributed in clumps, dominant individuals will be able to exploit most patches by following subordinates (Caraco_1989)\nIf patches are distributed in rich, clumps, scrounging should increase and if patches are evenly distributed, producing should increase (Dubois_2020) (Ohtsuka_2009)\n\nPatch finding rate\n\n(also under Patch density) At higher patch densities, the producer’s patch finding rate should decrease (Dubois_2005)\nWhen probability of finding patches decreases with increasing group size, number of scroungers should increase (Dubois_2020)\nWhen probability of finding patches increases with increasing group size, number of scroungers should decrease (Dubois_2020)\nDecreased patch finding rate reduces the costs of solitary foraging and scrounging is less common (Lee_2016)\nPatch finding rate strongly influences frequency of producers (Ohtsuka_2009)\nPatch finding rate increases with the number of producers (Rita_1997)\n\nPatch departure\n\nA producer should leave a patch earlier than a scrounger if the producer has a finder’s share (Rita_1997)\n\nResource monopolizabilitu\n\nEasily monopolized resources\n\nProducer scrounger models\n\nProducer priority where scrounging reduces producer’s food intake but does not depend on the number of scroungers in the group (Caraco_1991)\nScramble competition where producer’s food intake decreases with the number of scroungers (Caraco_1991)\n\nLearning\n\nEarly success may lead to individuals not adapting strategy to changing environments (Beauchamp_2000a)\nLearning never evolves to fixation and at a stable equilibrium there is a mixture of fixed and learning players (Dubois_2010)\nSocial learning is favored when competition is weak (Smolla_2015)\nIf competition is strong, social learning is favored when resource quality is highly variable and there is low environmental turnover (Smolla_2015)\n\nInformation\n\nExtra information held by producers can be both beneficial and harmful (Broom_2016).\nInformation not available to scrounger in situations where resources are not immediately visible eg. concelead nests, or where contest occurs quickly after patch is discovered and before producer has time to evaluate it (Broom_2016)\nProducers should fight for resources when costs of contests are high or scrounger has a small change of winning the contest eg. if patch is easily defended (Broom_2016)\nWhen scrounger’s potential cost is small compared to the value of the patch or if the scrounger has a high change of winning, the scrounger should always fight (Broom_2016)\n\nRelatedness\n\nIncreased relatedness can lead producers to being more tolerant of scrounging relatives (Mathot_2010)\n\nPopulation\n\nScrounging can act as a population regulator by reducing population level foraging efficiency and intake rate and allowing larger population sizes of predators (Coolen_2007)\nSocial foraging can stabilize one prey and two prey systems when scrounging is prevalent in predators (Toyokawa_2017) (Vickery_2020)\nScrounging can lower the growth rate of a population (Toyokawa_2017)\nScrounging can allow prey resources to persist at higher densities than if scrounging was absent (Toyokawa_2017) (Vickery_2020)\nPresence of scroungers in a predator can reduce the total amount of resource acquired by the group (Vickery_2020)\nPresence of scroungers in a predator can limit group size (Vickery_2020)\nPresence of scroungers in a predator can limit a predator’s ability to outcompete other species promoting stability and species diversity (Vickery_2020)\nScrounging will not stability population dynamics, food chains and competitor interactions under all cases, if scrounging is too prevalent it can push the population to extinction - Other factors such as food abundance, variations in weather, predators and parasites may have stronger effects that can completely obscure the effects of scrounging on populations (Vickery_2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterspecific social information\n\nKane_2014\n(also under Predation risk) Scrounging more common when interspecific competition for food with high predation risk

for subordinates (Bugnyar_2002)\n(also under Sex) Dominant females scrounged from subordinate neighbors with whom they had a strong social affiliation (King_2009)\n(also under Environmental factors) Wind exposure as a proxy to manipulate overnight energy expenditure lead dominants to scrounge more often and subordinates only marginally increase scrounging (Lendvai_2004)\nDominant individuals obtained more food than subordinates (Teichroeb_2015)\nDominant individuals obtained a larger share when producing than scrounging, balancing predation risk with food acquisition (Teichroeb_2015)\nFinder’s share increased with dominance (Teichroeb_2015)\n\nSocial affiliation\n\nMating pairs may have contributed to male tolerance of female scroungers (Aplin_2017)\nScroungers had high network centrality (Aplin_2017)\nSharing observed when dyads of ravens were at different stages of pair bonding eg mutual preening (Bugnyar_2002)\n(also under Sex) Dominant females scrounged

    "text": "Social foraging theory and habitat selection are related but relatively distinct bodies of literature. Whereas social foraging theory is concerned with the interdependence of individuals’ foraging strategies (Giraldeau and Caraco 2000), habitat selection is interested in the relationship between an an individuals’ used and available habitats (Matthiopoulos, Fieberg, and Aarts 2023). Approaches to social foraging theory most commonly include evolutionary game theory models and empirical tests, where the outcomes are centered on observed behaviours and optimal strategies (Table S2). Habitat selection analyses seek to determine species distributions, inference of selection for habitat variables and predictions of expected use of novel spatial and temporal landscapes (Matthiopoulos, Fieberg, and Aarts 2023). Despite their differences in focus and methodology, habitat selection and social foraging theory are unified by their shared interest in how animals use behaviour to balance the costs and benefits of their habitats. I have identified that habitat selection can lend a comprehensive definition of habitat to social foraging theory, and that social foraging theory can offer a precision to the habitat selection definition of availability.\nWhile the producer-scrounger literature has not explicitly tested the influence of a diverse set of habitat risks and conditions (Table 1), a broad set of related variables have been identified as individual constraints (Box 3). Dominiance, relatedness and energy reserves, for example, have been shown to have large contributions to an animal’s foraging strategy and their corresponding foraging success among conspecifics. In future empirical tests, risks and conditions must be carefully integrated to avoid confounding with individual constraints. In addition, more empirical tests are required on species underrepresented in the literature. Most species were only involved in one empirical test (Table S4) and entire classes of vertebrates were not represented (Table S3). Conflicts in the literature, such as the compatibility between vigilance behaviour and scrounging, and parsing the influences of age and sex from dominance on scrounging, require cross taxa review.\nThe proposed extension of resource availability to consider an individual’s role in producer-scrounger dynamics offers the methodological integration of social foraging theory into habitat selection analyses. As the concept of availaility in habitat selection has developed, the subset of habitat that is realistically accessible has been constrained using variables related to the animal’s movement (Aarts et al. 2008; Thurfjell, Ciuti, and Boyce 2014; Avgar et al. 2016). By incorporating behaviours, the distinctions between available and accessible habitats can be further refined. Firstly, measuring habitat selection within behavioural states, such as exploratory and encamped states, will reduce imprecision resulting from aggregating across differences in behaviour due to time of day, seasons of migration or reproduction (Langrock et al. 2012; Patterson_2018?). Next, within behavioural states relevant to foraging, incorporating how differences in access and availability strategies affect access and availability will help further improve selection in producer-scrounger dynamics. Lastly, developing methods for identifying foraging strategies in producer-scrounger dynamics using remotely sensed animaal movement data will allow researchers to apply these methods to an ever growing abundance of data (Kays et al. 2015; Nathan et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAarts, Geert, Monique MacKenzie, Bernie McConnell, Mike Fedak, and Jason Matthiopoulos. 2008. “Estimating Space-Use and Habitat Preference from Wildlife Telemetry Data.” Ecography 31 (1): 140–60. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0906-7590.05236.x.\n\n\nAvgar, Tal, Jonathan R.

    "text": "Barnard and Sibly (1981) define patch payoffs as the amount of any resource. Resources, in contrast with the reviewed literature (Table S1), are more broadly defined with examples given including nests, forage and mating opportunities.\nProducer-scrounger models differ in their assumptions and constraints on producer and scrounger payoffs and penalties. One example for scrounger payoffs is where all scroungers attend to all producer’s discovered patches and divide the remaining food items equally (after subtracting the finder’s share consumed exclusively by the producer) (Giraldeau 2000). The cost for producers depends on the rule defining the relationship between a producer and the number of scroungers in the group. For models that assume the producer-priority rule, the producer’s loss is independent on the number of scroungers while for models that assume the scramble-competition rule, the producer’s loss increases with the number of scroungers in the group (Giraldeau 2000).\n\n(Box) - Animal sociality is often described as a balance between advantages and disadvantages.

    "text": "Table 1 shows the environmental variables considered in the producer-scrounger literature reviewed (Table S1). The variables included are derived from the definition of habitat in Matthiopoulos, Fieberg and Aarts (2023): resources, risks and conditions. Only one article examined the influence of conditions (Ha and Ha, 2003). For the influence of risks, producer-scrounger models considered only predation risk in producer-scrounger models (Barta and Giraldeau, 2000; Dubois and Giraldeau, 2005; Dubois and Richard-Dionne, 2020), empirical tests (Bugnyar and Kotrschal, 2002), and the perception of predation in empirical tests (Barta, Liker and Mónus, 2004; Mathot and Giraldeau, 2007; Teichroeb, White and Chapman, 2015). The remaining references examine patch related variables of the habitat’s resources: patch density, richness, distribution and size.\n\nFigure 2 shows the graph visualization of all variables directly and indirectly related to the proportion of scrounging behaviour identified in the reviewed literature (Table S1). The variables shown are a subset of the full graph (Figure S1) to focus on the proportion of scrounging in a group. The relationships are also a subset of the full graph, where relationships to other outcome variable are excluded. For example, the relationship between patch richness and rate of aggression (Dubois, Giraldeau and Grant, 2003) is not shown because the relationship between proportion of scroungers and rate of aggression was not explicitly tested in the reviewed literature. Some variables influencing proportion of scroungers are related to access and availability of resource. Patch size (King, Isaac and Cowlishaw, 2009; Hansen et al., 2016) and patch distribution (Ohtsuka and Toquenaga, 2009; Dubois and Richard-Dionne, 2020) had a positive relationship with proportion of scrounging whereasa patch discovery rate (Ohtsuka and Toquenaga, 2009; Lee et al., 2016), and finder share (Barta and Giraldeau, 1998; Lee et al., 2016) had a negative relationship with proportion of scrounging. Beyond environmental variables, many other individual constraints are found to have influences on the proportion of scrounging including dominance (Caraco et al., 1989; Barta and Giraldeau, 1998; Bugnyar and Kotrschal, 2002; Werdenich and Huber, 2002; King, Isaac and Cowlishaw, 2009; Lee et al., 2016; Aplin and Morand-Ferron, 2017),energy reserves (Lendvai et al., 2004; Lee, Kuo and Chu, 2016), relatedness (Mathot and Giraldeau, 2010) and social affiliation (King, Isaac and Cowlishaw, 2009). Predation risks (and proxies to simulate predation risk) were the only form of risk considered in the reviewed producer-scrounger literature (Table 1) and there were conflicting results where Dubois and Richard-Dionne (2020) ’s game theoretical approach predicted a negative relationship with scrounging while Barta, Liker and Mónus (2004) and Mathot and Giraldeau (2007) found a positive relationship.\nFigure 3 shows the graph visualization of all variables directly and indirectly related to the group level effects of scrounging behaviour identified in the reviewed literature (Table S1). The variables shown are a subset of the full graph (Figure S1) to focus on group level effects. The relationships are also a subset of the full graph, where some direct relationships with proportion of scroungers are not shown to emphasize group level effects. For example, energy reserves and patch density had direct relationships with proportion of scroungers in the group (Figure 2). Some group level outcomes are related to access and availability of resources. Proportion of scroungers in a group has a negative relationship with the total quantity foraged by the group (Vickery, 2020) and the group’s patch discovery rate (Coolen, 2002). Notably, dominance has a positive relationship with forage access and both dominance and energy reserves have a positive relationship with foraging efficiency, illustrating the constraints on individuals that can influence foraging strategy beyond patch payoffs and penalties (Caraco, 1979; Teichroeb, White and Chapman, 2015; Lee, Kuo and Chu, 2016).\nFigure S1 shows the graph visualization of all variables directly and indirectly related to producer-scrounger dynamics identified in the reviewed literature. The full graph has been reduced to emphasize two groups of variables in Figure 2 and Figure 3. The variables that directly and indirectly contribute to the proportion of scrounging in a group are shown in Figure 2. The group or population level effects of the proportion of scrounging and related variables are shown in Figure 3. The complexity of the full graph indicates the interconnectedness of animals’ environments, conspecifics and potential constraints in foraging. Notably, there are few environmental variables beyond resource patch characteristics such as patch richness, distribution, and size. Social variables including relatedness, affiliations and dominance are well described. Some notable disagreements in the literature include the relationship between antipredator vigilance and scrounging behaviour (Ranta et al., 1996, 1998; Mathot and Giraldeau, 2007), age related differences in scrounging behaviour (Teichroeb, White and Chapman, 2015; Aplin and Morand-Ferron, 2017), and the contribution of learning on the frequency of scrounging behaviour (Afshar, Hall and Giraldeau, 2015; Aplin and Morand-Ferron, 2017).\nTable S2 shows the counts of approaches used to study producer-scrounger dynamics in the reviewed literature (Table S1). Of the literature deemed relevant, an empirical approach was used in 62 % of studies (N = 86 / 139), an producer-scrounger model with an evolutionary game theory approach was used in 20 % of studies (N = 28 / 139) and other approaches were used in 18 % of studies (N = 25 / 139). Five articles used multiple approaches including the earliest study where Barnard and Sibly (1981) used both a producer-scrounger model and an empirical test.\nTable S3 shows the counts of species studied in empirical tests of producer-scrounger dynamics in the reviewed literature (Table S1). Three species of birds (spice finches (Lonchura punctulata), zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and house sparrows (Passer domesticus)) make up 35 % (N = 33 / 93) of studied species. Notably, all other species were studied only three or less times with 34 species only being studied once.\nTable S4 shows the counts of taxonomic classes studied in empirical tests of producer-scrounger dynamics in the reviewed literature (Table S1). There is a majority representation of Aves. The earliest empirical tests of producer-scrounger dynamics include Barnard and Sibly’s work on house sparrows (Passer domesticus) (1981) and Giraldeau and Lefebvre’s work on pigeons (Columba livia) (1986). di Bitetti and Janson’s test producer-scrounger dynamics on capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) (2001) was the first empirical test of producer-scrounger dynamics on a mammalian species. Western buffalo breams (Kyphosus cornelii) were the first ray-finned fish species (Hamilton and Dill, 2003). Finally in 2016, producer-scrounger dynamics were tested in arachnids (Dumke, Herberstein and Schneider, 2016) and insects (Katz and Naug, 2016). Notable vertebrate groups that are not represented in the results of this literature survey include reptiles, amphibians, jawless fishes, lobe-finned fishes and cartilagenous fishes.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAfshar, M., Hall, C.L. and Giraldeau, L.-A.

    "text": "To address the question: “How does one’s role in frequency-dependent producer-scrounger dynamics influence access to available resources considering risks and conditions during habitat selection?”, I defined three goals: 1) to determine how foraging strategies differ in access to available resources, 2) to determine how risks and conditions influence foraging strategies and 3) to consider how the concept of availability during habitat selection can be extended to include foraging strategies. For 1) and 2), I identified empirical tests and model predictions in the literature that contribute to our understanding of access to resources and the influence of habitat risks and conditions. For 3), I propose an extension to the concept of availability from habitat selection analyses to incorporate role in producer-scrounger dynamics.\nRecall the Matthiopoulos, Fieberg, and Aarts (2023) definition of habitat as the collection of environmental variables categorized as resources, risks and conditions. The literature reviewed (Table S1) has overwhelmingly focused on the influence of resources on producer-scrounger dynamics, leaving the influence of risks and conditions largely ignored (Table 1). Of the studies that examined the influence of risks, they mainly did so using proxies for perception of predation risk in controlled environments (eg. Barta, Liker, and Mónus 2004; Mathot and Giraldeau 2007; but see Bugnyar and Kotrschal 2002). Only one study considered the influence of conditions, though it is deemed here an example of kleptoparasitism rather than producer-scrounger dynamics because food items were indivisible (Ha and Ha 2003, see details in Conditions below).\nThe reviewed literature has also explored many constraints on individuals beyond resources, risks and conditions that shape foraging strategy use and access to available resources including dominance (Caraco et al. 1989; Werdenich and Huber 2002; King, Isaac, and Cowlishaw 2009; A. G. E. Lee et al. 2016), energy reserves (Lendvai et al. 2004; Y.-F. Lee, Kuo, and Chu 2016) and learning (Afshar, Hall, and Giraldeau 2015; Aplin and Morand-Ferron 2017) (Box 3). I will take the logic from Dubois and Giraldeau (2005) who posited that predation risk should only influence foraging strategy use if it disproportionately affects certain strategies. Extending this, I concentrate among all the potential variables (Figure S1) to focus on those affecting access and availability of resources differentially depending on role in producer-scrounger dynamics. For clarity and equivalence with Figures 2, 3, and S1, I will discuss only in terms of proportion of scrounging behaviour where negative influences on the proportion of scrounging are equivalent to positive influences on the proportion of producing."

    "text": "Influence of habitat on foraging strategy\n\nResources\nAccess to resources differed between roles in producer-scrounger dynamics when the availability of resources favored one foraging strategy over the other. Producers have an initial period of solitary foraging before scroungers join them on the patch. This priority access, termed the finder’s share, offers an advantage where producers can forage without interference before scroungers join the patch. Scroungers conversely had an advantage when the discovered patches were large or rich in resources, offering an abundance beyond the finder’s share.\nIn evolutionary game theory approaches (Table 1), the differences in access to available resources are incorporated directly in the payoffs and penalties of each foraging strategy (See Box 1). The finder’s share represents both the benefit to a producer for being on the patch first, and also the cost to a scrounger for the effort in joining them, either as a temporal delay or a movement cost (Giraldeau and Caraco 2000). As the finder’s share increases, the proportion of scroungers in the group or population decreases (Barta and Giraldeau 1998; Ohtsuka and Toquenaga 2009; A. G. E. Lee et al. 2016). The rate at which producers find patches, termed the patch discovery rate, also influences the proportion of scroungers. When patches are more easily discovered, the costs of producing decreases and, correspondingly, the proportion of scroungers decreases (Dubois and Giraldeau 2005; A. G. E. Lee et al. 2016). In sum, if patches are easily found or if finder’s share is large, the producer strategy is favored in the group.\nLarge, rich or clumped patches lead to an increase in the proportion of scroungers. When patches are large and rich, the food items on the patch remaining after the finder’s share, termed the scrounger’s share, are larger. As the scrounger’s share increases, so do the benefits to scroungers and the proportion of scrounging is expected to increase in the group or population (Beauchamp 2000; Dubois and Giraldeau 2005; Dubois and Richard-Dionne 2020). The distribution of patches also influences the proportion of scrounging through the influence on patch discovery rate. When patches are scattered and clumped patches, patches less easily discovered and scrounging is favoured\nEmpirical tests confirmed some of the relationships between resources and foraging strategy use predicted from the evolutionary game theory models described above. Individuals were more likely to scrounge when the finder’s share decreased either due to patch size (King, Isaac, and Cowlishaw 2009; Hansen et al. 2016) or due to patch richness (Teichroeb, White, and Chapman 2015; Kok, Stears, and Shrader 2017). For example, scrounger veld goats (Capra hircus) decided to join a producer’s patch even after a longer delay when patch richness was higher (Kok, Stears, and Shrader 2017). Some of the evolutionary game theory predictions were not explicitly considered in the empirical tests including how the proportion of scrounging in a group is influenced by patch discovery rate and patch distribution.\n\n\n\nRisks\nRisks related to social foraging are often implied in producer-scrounger models but rarely explicitly evaluated. Barnard and Sibly (1981) only indirectly consider the risks of conspecifics increasing competition in foraging in their foundational work on producer-scrounger dynamics. Giraldeau and Caraco (2000) emphasize that social foraging theory is not the study of how foraging groups have evolved, for example in response to predation pressure, but rather focused on the economic interdependence of individual foraging decisions where penalties such as predation risk can be incorporated. I reviewed the literature to determine if risks might disproportionately affect foraging strategies. Only seven studies explicitly investigated how foraging strategy use is influenced by predation risk (Table 1; 8.4 % of relevant studies) and one investigated risks associated with fighting costs (Table 1; 1.2 % of relevant studies).\nConsider, for example, if animals are more vulnerable to predation if they are searching for forage patches (producing) than if they are monitoring conspecifics for opportunities to scrounge. If an animal scrounging also reduces their individual predaiton risk, it could be the preferred foraging strategy where predation risk is high. In addition, if the foraging group benefits from scroungers’ increased vigilance, it could also be an explanation for producers’ tolerance of scroungers in the group (Ranta et al. 1996, 1998). The relationship between scrounging and antipredator vigilance, however, is contested.\nMathot and Giraldeau (2007) simulated predation risk using wing-loading manipulations on zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and measured the time allocated to vigilance. Despite an increase in scrounging behaviour at higher predation risks, they could not separate the contribution of antipredator vigilance, spatial position in the group and head orientation (head up vigilant or head down foraging) on proportion of time scrounging. Barta, Liker, and Mónus (2004) tested whether distance from cover as a proxy for predation risk increased use of scrounging behaviour in tree sparrows (Passer montanus). While scrounging behaviour was more common further from cover, it did not correspond to an increase in time vigilant. Finally, Coolen and Giraldeau (2003) found no evidence of compatibility between scrounger behaviour and antipredator vigilance in an experimental manipulation of predation risk in spice finches (Lonchura punctulata). Taken these, empirical tests find no correspondence between scrounging behaviour and antipredator vigilance.\nWhile scrounging behaviour is not found to be related to antipredator vigilance, Bugnyar and Kotrschal (2002) found that individuals were more likely to scrounge when predation risk. Bugnyar and Kotrschal (2002) evaluated the proportion of scrounging behaviour depending on predation risk using a multispecies system of ravens (Corvus corax) scavenging either among wolves (Canis lupus) or among wild boars (Sus scrofa). Wolves would aggressively defend their food and potentially kill ravens, while wild boars would not. Foraging behaviour was categorized as producing when ravens attempted to obtain food directly from wolves or wild boars and categorized as scrounging when ravens attempted to obtain food from conspecifics. The proportion of scrounging was higher in ravens among wolves than among wild boars. While this result is indicative of ravens changing foraging strategy depending on predation risk, the definition of producing behaviour is different from other examples in the literature because of this interspecific system. Producing is normally considered as obtaining forage independent of conspecifics, and Bugnyar and Kotrschal (2002) classify raven behaviour as producing when they are attempting to steal forage from an allospecific individual. The relationship of foraging strategy use and predation risk requires some bolstering from additional empirical tests, possibly in an intraspecific system evaluating scrounging across a gradient of predation risk.\nWhen the density of conspecifics is high, there is an increased risk of competition or contest [Matthiopoulos, Fieberg, and Aarts (2023); Table 1]. Broom, Johanis, and Rychtář (2015) explicitly considered the influence of cost of contest on foraging strategy use by considering two different cost functions. Convex cost functions had small intial costs but quickly grew larger, and concave cost functions had high initial costs but continued investment is comparatively small. Convex cost functions correspond to major costs such as risk of injury, and concave cost functions correspond to time costs such as exposure to predation risk. Instead of a binary determination for engaging in a contest, individuals could invest effort along a particular cost function. Broom, Johanis, and Rychtář (2015) predicted that at high levels of maximum investment, scroungers should obtain resources at some cost for convex functions while producers should obtain resources without contest for concave functions. Despite these predicted relationships with foraging strategy use, there are no empirical tests of different cost functions. While a continuous measure of effort invested in contests seems more biologically relevant, it is unclear how it could be measured in wild populations.\n\n\nConditions\nThe general relationship between an animal’s expected fitness and habitat conditions is likely to follow a Gaussian function, where average conditions for a particular species have a neutral relationship and extreme conditions have a negative relationship (and could then be considered risks) (Matthiopoulos, Fieberg, and Aarts 2023). How conditions influence foraging strategies in producer-scrounger dynamics, however, is poorly studied. Only one article in the reviewed literature (Table S1) explored a habitat condition (temperature) and found no influence on foraging strategy use [Ha and Ha (2003); Table 1]. In addition, given the food items in this study were indivisible, it is an example of kleptoparasitism rather than of producer-scrounger dynamics. Given the lack of attention in the producer-scrounger literature on how conditions influence foraging strategy, I will consider how conditions influence foraging behaviour more generally to posit some potential relationships with foraging strategy use.\nAnimals can use behavioural adjustments to manage extreme temperatures. Preferred forage patches, for example, may be found in areas more vulnerable to high heat due to lack of canopy cover. Animals that choose to forage in these patches regardless will be required to also engage in heat-dissipating behaviours such as panting that may reduce overall foraging efficiency (du Plessis et al. 2012; Cunningham, Gardner, and Martin 2021). If animals select lower quality forage patches that are less vulnerable to high heat, they may require longer periods of foraging to achieve similar energy intake rates (Cunningham, Gardner, and Martin 2021). If heat-dissipating behaviours are more compatible with scrounging behaviour, for example through panting while surveying conspecifics, it may be a preferred strategy under extreme temperatures. In cold temperatures, animals can use social thermoregulation by huddling in dense aggregations to reduce exposed body surface area and minimize heat loss (Gilbert et al. 2010). There is a positive relationship between group size and forager density on the proportion of scroungers in a group Alfaro and Cabrera (2021). If animals aggregate in larger groups to manage cold temperatures, and if scrounging behaviour is more common in larger groups, then scrounging behaviour may be favored in cold temperatures. However, support from empirical studies that directly address the causal relationships between these variables is required to draw any conclusions.\nWind can influence the detection of prey (Cherry and Barton 2017; Fogarty et al. 2017), activity rates, and movement costs (Cherry and Barton 2017; Studd et al. 2022) in foraging animals. Studd et al. (2022) found contrasting effects of wnd speed on behaviour in snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis). On windy days, time allocated to activity and travel decreased in snowshoe hares and red squirrels but increased in lynx. Lynx also had more feeding events while snowshoe hares and red squirrels spent more time vigilant. These results show how wind can have different effects on behaviour between species but not necessarily indicate how different foraging behaviours within species might be affected. Considering the influence of wind on detection of prey, however, may highlight a potential effect on foraging strategy use. Recall that as patch discovery rate increases, the proportion of scroungers in a group increase (Dubois and Giraldeau 2005; A. G. E. Lee et al. 2016). If detection of prey is negatively influenced by wind (Cherry and Barton 2017; Fogarty et al. 2017), then the proportion of scroungers in the group may increase. Again, support from empirical studies is needed to determine if this relationship holds.\nOther conditions that may influence foraging strategy use are related to a scrounger’s ability to join a producer. Ruxton, Fraser, and Broom (2005) found that the distance at which a scrounger decides to join a producer increases with increasing movement speed. If conditions such as increased snow depth result in decreased movement speed, an individual may opt not to join a producer’s patch they would normally join under different conditions. Movement rates decreased in wolves during snowfall events (Canis lupus) (Droghini and Boutin 2018) and in wood bison as cumulative snow depth increased throughout the winter season (Bison bison athabascae) (Sheppard et al. 2021). This may result in seasonal advantages to the producer strategy where scroungers are disadvantaged when movement is more challenging. Another potential influence of conditions posited by Vickery et al. (1991) is that when scroungers have reduced sensory contact with producers, the group size and rate of scrounging should decrease. This may occur, for example, due to wind and fog, or in aquatic animals due to the turbidity of water (Vickery et al. 1991). Intraspecific social interactions, including communication and group formation, are expected to be affected by abiotic environmental change (Fisher et al. 2021).\n\n\nComplex interactions\nResources, risks and conditions are expected to have numerous and complex interactions (Matthiopoulos, Fieberg, and Aarts 2023). Similarly, the reviewed literature indicated interactions between multiple variables related to producer-scrounger dynamics. In this discussion and in Figures 2, 3, and S1, interactions were not included to focus on the relationships between pairs of variables. Some examples of interactions include resource availability, foraging effort and proportion of scrounging (Dubois and Giraldeau 2005) and group size, energy intake and foraging success (Bélisle 1998). Given the possibility of interactions and that the influence of many risks and conditions on producer-scrounger dynamics have yet to be studied (Table 1), future empirical studies should consider many environmental variables concurrently to help tease out causal relationships and identify interacting variables."

    "section": "Contrasting approaches to availability",
    "text": "Contrasting approaches to availability\nHabitat selection theory and producer-scrounger dynamics have different assumptions regarding availability of habitat. Social foraging theory seeks to determine how foraging behaviour is affected by conspecifics (Vickery et al. 1991). In producer-scrounger dynamics, the frequency of foraging strategies in a group or population contribute to the payoffs and penalties for individuals and the optimal behavioural choice is the one that cannot be improved by any alternative choice (Vickery et al. 1991; Giraldeau and Caraco 2000). Models of producer-scrounger dynamics often assume that any patch discovered by a producer is available to all scroungers, disregarding the distance between patches or movement costs Beauchamp (2008). Behavioural selection of habitat is the preferential use of a habitat, disproportionate to its availability (Beyer et al. 2010; Matthiopoulos, Fieberg, and Aarts 2023). The definition and calculation of availability can influence predictions (Matthiopoulos et al. 2020) and different scales of availability can change the direction and magnitude of selection Beyer et al. (2010). In contrast with models of producer-scrounger dynamics, the definition of availability is integral to estimating habitat selection.\nHabitat selection analyses have used different definitions of availability and recent increases in computational power have allowed for more precise and realistic approaches. If availability is defined as the total area encompassing an animal’s locations (eg. a bounding box), or as an animal’s home range, it is assumed that all locations in the area are equally accessible to the animal or that the animal can detect equal representation of each habitat in order to select preferred habitats (Aarts et al. 2008). Availability in step selection analyses is constrained by the animal’s movement where available points are drawn from probability density functions defining possible distances (step length) and directions (turn angle) travelled (Aarts et al. 2008; Johnson et al. 2008; Thurfjell, Ciuti, and Boyce 2014).\n\nAn extension to step selection analyses is to include behaviour to further refine the definition of availability (Johnson et al. 2008). Behavioural specific habitat selection can improve our understanding of animals selection depending on behavioural states (Roever et al. 2014; Abrahms et al. 2016; Suraci et al. 2019). For example, animals may select certain habitats that provide cover when resting, but avoid these same habitats when travelling or foraging. We can potentially better characterize availability by defining it based on behavioural state. By extension, considering the producer-scrounger dynamics in the concept of availability for habitat selection analyses, producers and scroungers are expected to have different habitats available. Recall that scroungers only forage on patches discovered by producers. If the forage availability for scroungers is defined by the spatial relationship of their nearest producer conspecifics, availability could be more accurately represented by incorporating these social foraging relationships. A novel habitat selection methodology could be developed to incorporate availability depending on role in producer-scrounger dynamics, and behavioural state. to specifically consider foraging specific habitat selection."

Scrounging is a variance-averse strategy and is less sensitive to changes in patch quality variance than average patch quality. Learning rule models are better tools, to handle complex situations and in their simplicity, to study and predict animal behaviour in frequency-dependent systems than the evolutionarily stable strategy approach. Agent based models using learning rules can incorporate multiple ecological parameters to describe environments more realistically."

If patches were easy to find and individuals were unable to monopolize resources, scrounging became less common. Under conditions of strong monopolization and intermediate discovery rates, higher levels of scrounging occurred\nTwo main predictions: 1 The effects of resource scarcity on social information use should depend on resource monopolizability. 2 The potential benefits of social dominance should be closely linked to social information use in uncertain environments.\nThere are constrains that competition imposes on an individual’s ability to use social information to access resources. When resources are monopolizable, social information use may become exclusive to dominant individuals leading to a positive relationship between social rank and resource acquisition rate.\nSelection pressures on dominance will depend on multidimensional aspects of resources eg. scarcity, depletion rate and monopolizability"

Concerned with the functional advantage of sociality. Assume all individuals search independently while simultaneously observing each other. When a patch is found, all individuals feed on it. This assumption if called complete compatibility.\nUnlike [information-sharing-models], producer-scrounger models do not assume all group members behave in the same way. Some individuals specialize in producing and others in scrounging. At a given play of the game, a producer cannot scrounger and a scrounger cannot produce. This assumption is called complete incompatibility.\nThese two extremes are likely unrealistic with partial compatibility being more likely.

The remainder is divided equally between the producer and all scroungers (including opportunists), where the total consumed by scroungers is the scrounger’s share.\nSolitary foraging could be a solution for producers to avoid sharing with scroungers. This may not be possible when food is localized and presence of others cannot be escaped. Trade off of others balanced with predation risk.\n\n\nFocus\nReconcile information-sharing and producer-scrounger models of group foraging\n\n\nOutcome\nThese three strategies can only coexist when opportunist’s loss in searching ability is exactly equal to its gain in scrounging ability. All pairs of strategies can coexist, depending on relative producing ability and relative scrounging ability of opportunists and the finder’s share."

Within groups, a negative correlation was found between scrounging and scanning rate. These results are more similar to Coolen_2001, Coolen_2003 rather than Ranta_1998. This alternatively may be due to scrounging being a risk averse strategy and due to scrounging being a favored strategy when energy levels are low."

However, models for two other species, the Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) and Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), improved substantially through reduced prediction error (assessed with cross-validation) and were much more likely to be an appropriate model (by reducing the deviance of the fitted models). These results indicate that habitat-selection models can be an improvement over correlative habitat-use models.

Scrounging in the top predator of a tritrophic food chain can stabilize interactions between the top predator, its prey and its prey’s prey. Presence of scroungers reduces the total amount of resource acquired by the group. Scrounging limits group size, impact on prey and ability of a predator to outcompete other species, promoting stability and species diversity.\nHigher growth rates of the resource require high scrounging frequencies to prevent instability on the system. Low growth rates allow coexistence only when the finder’s advantage is high and scrounging frequency is low. If encounter rate is high, scrounging will be rare.\nScrounging will not stabilize population dynamics, food chains and competitor interactions under all cases. If scrounging is too prevalent, it can push the population to extinction. Other factors such as food abundance, variations in weather, predators and parasites may have stronger effects that can completely obscure the effects of scrounging."

These models were static and state independent and could not explore whether time of day, animal’s state and degree of predation hazard influenced individual decisions to use either strategy\nNext steps: incorporate dominance asymmetries and allow foragers the choice to forage alone\n\nStrategies\nProducer, scrounger\n\n\nFrequency dependence\n\n\nPayoffs\nWhen scrounging is rare, it is assumed to do better than the producer alternative because it can take advantage of the many exploitable food patches discovered by the producers. When scrounging is common, the number of individuals competing as scroungers increases and the payoffs for scroungers declines.\nSurvival probability is the currency used here instead of net food intake to determine how the use of either strategy impacts individuals’ survival probability\n\n\nPenalties\nThe nighttime non foraging period reduces animal’s energy reserves that are replenished during daylight. Foraging increases risk of predation while resting decreases risk of predation while consuming energy\n\n\nResources\n\n\nRisks\nPredation / hazard risk. Scroungers surveying for producers finding patches also provides a lower predation hazard as a by-product and to include this, the authors set the predation hazard for scroungers to half that of the producers.\n\n\nConditions\n\n\nAccess\nAll scroungers get equal access to each producer’s patch minus the producer’s share. Patch-finding rate and amount of food in a patch were constant. Varying patchiness did not change the average daily stable proportion of scrounging but increasing patchiness decreased the probability of survival in most cases.\n\n\nFocus\nState-dependent dynamic producer-scrounger game that predicts early in the day when energy reserves are low, individuals will prefer the scrounger strategy. Late in the day, individuals will favor the producer strategy. Under rich and clumped food, scrounging will improve daily survival of all group members.\n\n\nOutcome\nThe proportion of individuals scrounging is predicted to change through the day, highest around dawn and dusk and lowest around midday because the scrounger obtains small amounts of food in a reliable way while the producer either acquires high or no food intake. Producing is optimal in midday if individuals are near or above their critical reserve level because if a producer is successful they are likely able to switch to resting sooner and avoid predation hazard."

This is due to the finders_share that lets producers pay more for defense than a scrounger can for appropriation.\nIncreasing group size will increase the rate of playing scrounger and increase the costs of aggression. Few scroungers are expected at the equilibrium when the number of foragers is small.\nIncreasing patch density will reduce the time required for producers to find patches and the temporal costs associated with aggressive appropriation will make scrounger less profitable. Encounters will decline as the number of producers increases.\nIncreasing patch richness will increase the scrounger’s share and the proportion of scroungers within the group. Scroungers are more likely to get required food to offset expenses of aggressive appropriation.\nCosts of aggression increase with predation pressure as the increased probability of being killed by a predator while engaged in a fight increase. Aggression should reduce when predation hazard increases but non-aggressive scroungers will be unsuccessful securing food from aggressive producers. Otherwise, scroungers are likely to switch to producing, reducing the proportion of scroungers and decreasing the number of challenges but with lower numbers of scroungers, the aggressiveness increases."

    "text": "C1: The ecology behind species-habitat association models\n\n1.2 How do living beings “see” the world around them?\nPriority for an organism’s fitness and distribution is whether it has a positive, negative or ambivalent relationship with aspects of its environment\nEnvironment = resources + risks + conditions\n\n1.2.1 resources\nresources are substances, objects or places in the environment required by an organism for normal growth, maintenance and reproduction\nGenerally, resources have a positive effect on fitness:\n\n(for plants) sunlight, carbon dioxide, minerals, water\n(for animals) prey, water, nesting spaces, resting spaces\n\nIn overabundance of resources or high density of individuals, resources can turn into risk with negative effects on fitness:\n\nlarge quantity of food consumed where food is poisonous at high doses\nexcess light damaging photosynthetic machinery\nreduced resources due to intraspecific competition (conspecifics) or interspecific competition (heterospecifics)\n\n\n\n1.2.2 risks\nrisks are environmental variables lower the actual or perceived chances of individual survival or reproduction and have a negative effect on fitness\nrisks shape distributions by influencing demographic rates (predation, ultimately death). Perception of risk may be just as influential, see Landre_et_al_2010.\nPresence of risks may limit actual presence of species, eg. where hosts are missing where parasites exist.\nrisks are often dynamic processes that are difficult to quantify. See Palmer_et_al_2017.\n\n\n1.2.3 conditions\nconditions are environmental variables that surround the organism and influence its functioning.\n\nambient temperature\nsalinity\nhumidity\n\nconditions can have positive, negative or ambivalent effects on fitness. Eg. outside of limits of ambient temperature, organisms can die or stop functioning properly.\nSee Oddling_Smee_et_al_2013 for modification of conditions by organisms.\n\n\n1.2.4 Interactions between resources, risks and conditions\n\nresources - risks\n\n“Is it worth the risk?” (Brown_and_Kotler_2004)\neg. predation risks causing organisms to avoid high resource density areas (McNammara_and_Houston_1987)\nSurviving individuals in areas of high risk will have lower resource competition which may lead to an increase in overall population fitness (Van_Leeuwen_et_al_2008)\n\nresources - conditions\n\nEnvironmental conditions influence on detection and intake of resources\neg. depth and sediment type on accessibility of marine invertebrates to predators (De_Goeij_and_Honkoop_2022)\n\nrisks - conditions\n\neg. detection risk of prey by predator given canopy cover (Brown_and_Koetler_2004)\n\nresources - risks - conditions\n\neg. warm blooded marine mammals in polar environments, balancing risk of hypothermia with prey resource under cold temperature conditions (Grady_et_al_2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 What is a habitat?\nRecommendation is at the outset of an analysis, define habitat as a point in environmental space whose dimensions are environmental variables (resources, risks, conditions). This habitat is aspatial and species agnostic but can be used to map onto geographic space and/or determine species specific associations.\n\nIs habitat a place or a set of circumstances?\n\nA region in space intuitively captures the environmental variables. However this perspective has methodological disadvantages: - requires space to be divided apriori into parts which presents challenges given nested spatial scales - scale depends on species’ mobility and perception - environment is dynamic, changing seasonally or abruptly given anthropogenic or natural drivers - models specific to one location can be challenging to use for predictions to new locations\n\nShould habitat comprise just conditions or also include resources and risks?\n\nFor distribution of moving animals, resource selection functions (Manly_et_al_2002) initially included only food selection, later also incorporated conditions and risks.\nAll three types of environmental variables (resources, risks and conditions) ultimately influence fitness and distribution. Complex interactions between them prevent considering them in total isolation. Therefore, the definition of habitat necessarily includes all three.\n\nIs habitat specific specific or independent?\n\nProblems with specific specific definitions of habitat:\n\nit is unknown apriori which environmental variables will be relevant to any focal species\nthe inferred relationship between species and habitat is not binary and models must allow for gradients of suitability\n\n\n\n1.4 What is a species-habitat association?\nA species-habitat association connects habitats to observations of a species (at the individual, group or population levels).\n\nAssociations between habitat and fitness\nHabitat-associated fitness is the contribution of each unit of habitat, X, to the populations long term log-rate of change. Partial fitness (Matthiopolous_et_al_2015) can be interpreted as the fitness of population living in an environment of entirely habitat X.\nMechanisms of habitat-associated fitness:\n\nsub-organismal\nlevel of physiological capabilities\nanatomy\nlife history strategies\n\n\n\nAssociations between [[habitat]] and changes in species density\nOrganisms experiencing low fitness must relocate or face demographic consequences. Relation involves movement of individuals, groups or populations. Their movement trajectories are an indication animals response to environments.\n\nmovements that are localized, sinuous indicate high resource availability\n\nThe density of species that cannot relocate will be affected by habitat-mediated survival and reproduction.\n\n\nAssociations between habitat and species density\nDynamics modify the relationship between habitat and species density.\nSpatial variation in density:\n\ndoes not reflect short term (minute/hour/day) mechanisms\ndoes reflect accumulated effects of processes operating at longer time scales (year/generations)\n\n\n\nFundamental and realized niche\nAssociations with fitness represent the fundamental niche of a species. The realized niche is represented by the eventual species distribution. The difference between these two are the dynamics represented by the associations between habitat and mechanisms of change in species distribution. Species distribution is not necessarily proportion to fitness.\n\n\n\n1.5 What mechanisms drive habitat-mediated changes in species density?\nDynamic mechanisms shape the relationship between fitness and species distribution\n\nindividual level: relative use of habitats\npopulation level: demographic forces\n\n\n1.5.1 Behavioural selection\nIt is important to consider and incorporate the underlying mechanisms or emergent, accessibility constraints shaping individual movement into models. Voluntary movement is made up of decision to leave, and where to go.\n\nStay or go, decision to leave.\n\nPatch departure rules, giving up times. See Charnov_1976, Brown_1988\nmarginal-value-theorem posits once an individual depletes local resources to a point where their intake is less than their average long term intake rate, they should leave the patch (Charnov_1976).\nActual/perceived long term intake rate may change due to environmental change or learning abilities. Animal often cannot instantaneously determine what local intake rate is, so they need to learn. Learning takes time and may lead to suboptimal decisions particularly if the environmental is unpredictable.\nSee Ollason_1980, Biernaskie_et_al_2009, Kamil_et_al_2019, Riotte_Lambert_et_al_2019\n\nWhere to go\n\nAnimal may move:\n\nrandomly, eg. isotropic or correlated random walks\ndirected movement based on\n\nsensory perception (Fagan_et_al_2013)\nspatial memory (Bracis_2017)\ninformation from conspecifics (Jesner_2018, Oliveira_Santos_2016, Merkle_2019)\n\n\nCognitive processes operate at several, widely different scales\n\n\n1.5.2 Demographic sorting\nThe distribution of all organisms (vs behavioural selection) is shaped by demographic processes highly dependent on spatially heterogeneous environmental variables.\nIt is difficult to tease apart the contributions of demographic processes and animal mobility on distributions. Eg. selection bias of observations since animals tagged with eg. GPS trackers are alive in capture location and therefore demographic sorting has already taken place and we can only study their behavioural selection.\n\n\n\n1.6 When is species density a reliable reflection of habitat suitability?\nOften we assume that high local density indicates that the local habitat is good for species. This is not necessarily the case, but if it is, the assumptions of the following null model can be used to related the intrinsic fitness of a habitat with species distribution.\n\n1.6.1 Why do we need a null model for species-habitat associations?\nNull models are mathematical constructs derived from sets of assumptions that form the basis for discussion on a physical process. Eg.\n\nlogistic model of population dynamics\nmodel of perfect mixing in predator prey dynamics\nmarginal-value-theorem\nneutral theory of biodiversity\n\nFor species-habitat associations, there has historically been an implicit null model without explicit mathematical formulation or assumptions.\n\n\n1.6.2 Null model for habitat-driven demographic sorting\nAssumptions\n\nhighly mobile dispersal stage, all space is equally accessible to all of its propagules\ncompletely sessile reproductive stage, local density results from local habitat quality\nintrinsic population growth solely driven by habitat, with positive values everywhere\nlocal population growth declines with local density\nno interspecific competition\n\nSee the book for full derivation of these formulas\nSee Matthiopolous_et_al_2015 where population growth rate relates to fitness of a population\n\\(N_{s, t+1} = N_{s, t} exp(F_{0}(x) - b N_{s, t})\\)\n\n\\(N_{s, t+1}\\): local population density at t + 1\n\\(N_{s, t}\\): local population density at t\n\\(F_{0}(x)\\): intrinsic fitness value of habitat\n\\(b\\): attrition on population growth of an added individual\n\nWhere the population density is very small, growth rate is equal to the intrinsic growth rate.\nWhere the population density is at an equilibrium local density, attrition caused by density dependence annuls the benefits of habitat and the equilibrium distribution is proportional to intrinsic growth rate.\n\n\n1.6.3 A null model for habitat selection\nBuilding on Fretwell_and_Lucas_1969 who consider the distribution of an ideal free species a purely behavioural phenomenon without demographic sorting.\nAssumptions\n\nindividuals are ideal, aware of the value of all patches and make rational ideal choices\nindividuals are free, they can select any patch and all individual are identical\n\nThe first individual will select the patch with the highest baseline suitability rate. By using this patch, the suitability with decrease. This is repeated for all individuals and eventually all patches will have equal suitability.\nSee the book for full derivation of these formulas\n\\(S(x, N_{s, t}) = B_{x} - f(N_{s, t})\\)\n\n\\(S\\): suitability of a given location\n\\(x\\): set of environmental variables\n\\(N_{s, t}\\): density\n\\(B_{x}\\): baseline suitability\n\\(f\\): growth rate/fitness\n\nMechanisms: interference and scramble-competition (Krivan_et_al_2008)\nUnder the first assumption, the baseline suitability is approximately the intrinsic value of the habitat (at low density) and the suitability is approximately the fitness/growth rate.\nFor each population there will be a unique ideal-free-distribution M. Where fitness declines linearly with local population size and where the population size M is at carrying capacity, we can set the equation equal to 0 and solve.\n\\(N_{S}^{*} = F_{0} / b\\)\nThe relationship between density and habitat suitability or fitness is identical to that for the ideal life history organism when the total population size is at carrying capacity.\n\n\n1.6.4 Is population size or population growth a better proxy for fitness?\nData on intrinsic growth rate are difficult to collect and observe since they require small population sizes. At equilibrium, “bad” patches will have locally extinct populations. If a limiting resource driving fitness is depletable, the abundance and distribution will differ between low and high densities.\nAt earlier stages of population growth and resource depletion, the correlation between food distribution and growth rates delivers an informative species-habitat association. At equilibrium distribution, depletion distorts inferences. Equilibrium density of the consumer will yield no relationship with food density but a strong positive relationship with food production/replenishment/productivity.\n\n\n\n1.7 When are assumptions of null models violated?\nProportional relationships between distribution and density is violated by\n\nNon linear relationships\nEquilibrium never reached due to demography, mobility and changing environments\n\n\n1.7.1 When relationship between species density and fitness is non linear\nObservations only capture occupancy/vacancy rather than continuous measures of suitability\nSpecies density and fitness can also be positively related eg. where increasing group size results in decreased predation risks, increases information transfer and services and allee effects (see Allee_1951, Stephens_and_Sutherland_1999).\n\n\n1.7.2 When species occur at places with negative fitness\nOrganisms are often encountered in poor quality habitats\n\ntransient state (Matthiopolous_et_al_2020)\nextinction debt where individuals are pushed to poor quality habitats, time lag as population declines\n\nZero niche paradox: viable animal populations in landscapes with no points of positive fitness. This can occur due to transient resources or conditions, or movement to enture overall positive fitness considering resources, risks and conditions.\n\n\n1.7.3 When species do not occur at places of positive fitness\n\nColonization credit (Watts_et_al_2020)\nMismatches may be due to imperfect information or dynamic environments\nSite fidelity (Matthiopolous_et_al_2005)\nEltonian viewpoint (Soberon_2007)\nLandscapes of fear\n\n\n\n\n1.8 The species-habitat association model we wish for and the species-habitat association model we have\nKey desire to assume: pseudo equilibrium assumption where presence is suitable and absence is unsuitable.\nGuisan_and_Huiller_2005 Gallion_et_al_2012\nMechanisms that violate null models:\n\nspecies abundance not consistently indicative of habitat suitability gradients\nspecies survive in areas of negative fitness\nextinction debts\ncolonization credits\n\nSo far, species distribution models inferences are only valid under the assumptions of the null model. Next,\n\ndifference between fitness and distribution\nwhat mechanisms make them different and violate the assumptions of the null model\nadd model features to correct for these differences\n\n\n\n1.9 A puritan taxonomy of species distribution models\nSpecies distribution models - Mechanistic - Empirical - Spatial interpolation - Habitat based - Use only - Use availability - Counts - Presence/absence - Point process\nSee citations"

    "text": "C1: Concepts, definitions, methods\nSocial foraging differs from individual foraging theory in that it requires economic interdependence of payoffs and penalties. An individual’s foraging behaviour and its functional consequence depends on the actions of the individual and the behaviour of other foragers. The majority of this book’s attention is on consequences for individuals with some on communities.\nComparing individual foraging theory, eg. Stephens_and_Krebs_1986, to social foraging theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual foraging theory\nSocial foraging theory\n\n\n\n\nPrey selection strategy for an individual involves attack probabilities for different prey and net rate of intake\nAdded complexity of considering 2+ predators for a shared clump of prey\n\n\n\nSocial criterion: 2+ individuals concurrently influence each other’s gains and losses\nHistorically, social groups are defined as individuals that derive evolutionary advantages from the presence of others while aggregations do not. Genuine attraction between individuals vs merely statistical coincidence.\nThis obscures the similarities between animals with complex social structures and those without. Eg. lions (complex) and pigeons (simpler/loose) both have food available to an individual dependent on the number of foragers in the group. Regardless of however “social” they can both be modelled with a similar social foraging model.\nSocial foraging theory is not the study of the origin of foraging groups. Social foraging does not treat antipredatory and energetic benefits as competing causes. Both are integrated into the currency of fitness.\nApproaches to social foraging theory:\n\ncomparative method correlating ecological conditions to population/species attributes\noptimization techniques\n\ncriticisms: Cohen_1976, Launde_1982, Gray_1987, Hines_1987\nresponses: Maynard_Smith_1978, Oster_Wislson_1978, Mayr_1983, Krebs_Davies_1984, Stephens_Krebs_1986, Schoener_1987\n\n\nNash equilibrium is a set of strategies (one for each player) such that no player can improve its payoff by changing strategy vs the other Nash equilibrium strategies. Nash equilibriums are stable if unilateral deviation reduces payoff.\nAn evolutionary-stable-strategy maximizes a player’s expected payoff. Stability may imply dynamics resistant to invasion by a rare strategy, or the consequences for an individual deviating from the evolutionary-stable-strategy. All evolutionary-stable-strategy are Nash equilibriums.\n\nStrategies may be\n\ndirectly equivalent to alleles\nmodified by the environment\nPure strategies are where there is a single action\n\nPopulations may be\n\nfinite\ninfinite\n\nPlay may be\n\nrepeated or not (single round)\ninformed or uninformed where each player chooses their action without knowledge of the action other players will take\n\nGames\n\nSymmetric where there is competitive equivalence of players with the same payoffs and penalties. No phenotypic attributes of individuals.\nDiscrete where each action is from a discrete set\n\n\nThis complexity has theoretical significance. The authors’ recommendation is to focus on phenotype. Assume selection has enhanced learning capacity and individuals can efficiently vary behaviour across environmental and social conditions.\nBox 1.1 Classes of behaviours that may occur among social foragers\n\nSelfish behaviour (positive effect on individual and negative on relatives)\nCooperative behaviour\n\nGroup selected altruism\nUnconditional cooperation\n\nKin-directed altruism (negative or neutral effect on individual and positive effect on relatives)\nMutualism (positive effect on individual and relatives)\n\nConditional cooperation\n\nReciprocal altruism\nConditional mutualism\n\n\n\nSearching\n\nat least some group members attempt to find food\nothers may avoid the cost of searching\nactive foragers may focus on different resources\ntime to locate patch depends on the number of individuals searching and their interacting efficiencies\nfood searching is treated as stochastic\n\nDividing\n\nfood is actively shared, divided equally\nallocated asymmetrically according to eg. dominance status\n\nThree types of social foragers\n\nProducers: search environment for food\nScroungers: do not search directly. They attend to other forager’s clump discoveries and aggressively or stealthily sequester some food\nOpportunist: both search directly and obtain food at clumps located by producers or opportunists. They are assumed less efficient than producers and scroungers.\n\nInteractions between types of social foragers\n\nProducer vs producer: equilibrium group size under controlled group-entry\nProducer vs scrounger: require some number of producers, depends on the cost of scrounging\nProducer vs opportunist: this interaction is not maintained under symmetric competition (Pulliam_and_Caraco_1984). Greater dominance status for opportunists or more efficient searching by producers will favor one or the other type.\nOpportunist vs opportunist: information-sharing systems, equivalent to group size under free entry\nScrounger vs opportunist: can persist due to knowledge limitation"

Nash equilibriums are stable if unilateral deviation reduces payoff.\nAn evolutionary-stable-strategy maximizes a player’s expected payoff. Stability may imply dynamics resisteant to invasion by a rare strategy, or the consequences for an individual deviating from the evolutionary-stable-strategy. All evolutionary-stable-strategy are Nash equilibries."
