    "text": "Giraldeau, L.A. and Caraco, T., 2000. Social foraging theory. Princeton University Press.\n\n\n\nSocial foraging differs from individual foraging theory in that it requires economic interdependence of payoffs and penalties. An individual’s foraging behaviour and its functional consequence depends on the actions of the individual and the behaviour of other foragers. The majority of this book’s attention is on consequences for individuals with some on communities.\nComparing individual foraging theory, eg. Stephens_and_Krebs_1986, to social foraging theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual foraging theory\nSocial foraging theory\n\n\n\n\nPrey selection strategy for an individual involves attack probabilities for different prey and net rate of intake\nAdded complexity of considering 2+ predators for a shared clump of prey\n\n\n\nSocial criterion: 2+ individuals concurrently influence each other’s gains and losses\nHistorically, social groups are defined as individuals that derive evolutionary advantages from the presence of others while aggregations do not. Genuine attraction between individuals vs merely statistical coincidence.\nThis obscurs the similarities between animals with complex social structures and those without. Eg. lions (complex) and pigeons (simpler/loose) both have food available to an individual dependent on the number of foragers in the group. Regardless of however “social” they can both be modeled with a similar social foraging model.\nSocial foraging theory is not the study of the origin of foraging groups. Social foraging does not treat antipredatory and energetic benefits as competing causes. Both are integrated into the currency of fitness.\nApproaches to social foraging theory:\n\ncomparative method correlating ecological conditions to population/species attributes\noptimization techniques\n\ncriticisms: Cohen_1976, Launde_1982, Gray_1987, Hines_1987\nresponses: Maynard_Smith_1978, Oster_Wislson_1978, Mayr_1983, Krebs_Davies_1984, Stephens_Krebs_1986, Schoener_1987\n\n\nNash equilibrium is a set of strategies (one for each player) such that no player can improve its payoff by changing strategy vs the other Nash equilibrium strategies. Nash equilibriums are stable if unilateral deviation reduces payoff.\nAn evolutionary-stable-strategy maximizes a player’s expected payoff. Stability may imply dynamics resisteant to invasion by a rare strategy, or the consequences for an individual deviating from the evolutionary-stable-strategy. All evolutionary-stable-strategy are Nash equilibries.\n\nStrategies may be\n\ndirectly equivalent to alleles\nmodified by the environment\nPure strategies are where there is a single action\n\nPopulations may be\n\nfinite\ninfinite\n\nPlay may be\n\nrepeated or not (single round)\ninformed or uninformed where each player chooses their action without knowledge of the action other players will take\n\nGames\n\nSymmetric where there is competitive equivalence of players with the same payoffs and penalties. No phenotypic attributes of individuals.\nDiscrete where each action is from a discrete set\n\n\nThis complexity has theoretical significance. The authors’ recommendation is to focus on phenotype. Assume selection has enhanced learning capacity and individuals can efficiently vary behaviour across environmental and social conditions.\nBox 1.1 Classes of behaviours that may occur among social foragers\n\nSelfish behaviour (positive effect on individual and negative on relatives)\nCooperative behaviour\n\nGroup selected altruism\nUnconditional cooperation\n\nKin-directed altruism (negative or neutral effect on individual and positive effect on relatives)\nMutualism (positive effect on individual and relatives)\n\nConditional cooperation\n\nReciprocal altruism\nConditional mutualism\n\n\n\nSearching\n\nat least some group members attempt to find food\nothers may avoid the cost of searching\nactive foragers may focus on different resources\ntime to locate patch depends on the number of individuals searching and their interacting efficiencies\nfood searching is treated as stochastic\n\nDividing\n\nfood is actively shared, divided equally\nallocated assymetrically according to eg. dominance status\n\nThree types of social foragers\n\nProducers: search environment for food\nScroungers: do not search directly. They attend to other forager’s clump discoveries and aggressively or stealthily sequester some food\nOpportunitist: both search directly and obtain food at clumps located by producers or opportunists. They are assumed less efficient than producers and scroungers.\n\nInteractions between types of social foragers\n\nProducer vs producer: equilibrium group size under controlled group-entry\nProducer vs scrounger: require some number of producers, depends on the cost of scrounging\nProducer vs opportunist: this interaction is not maintained under symmetric competition (Pulliam_and_Caraco_1984). Greater dominance status for opportunists or more efficient searching by producers will favor one or the other type.\nOpportunist vs opportunist: information-sharing systems, equivalent to group size under free entry\nScrounger vs opportunist: can persist due to knowledge limitation"
