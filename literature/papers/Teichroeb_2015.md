### Species
vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus)

### Strategies

### Frequency dependence

### Availability

### Resources
Artificial food patches of varied [richness](../topics/richness.md)

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
[spatial-position](../topics/spatial-position.md) within a foraging group. Tradeoff between maximizing safety by staying in group's center with foraging success

### Outcome
High ranking individuals, whether they scrounged or produced, obtained more food than subordinates but their overall share was greatest when they produced, balancing their trade off of [predation](../topics/predation.md) risk with food acquisition. No effect of age. Finder's share decreased with patch [richness](../topics/richness.md) and increased with rank.
