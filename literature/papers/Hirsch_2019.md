### Species
ring-tailed coatis (_Nasua nasua_)

### Strategies

### Frequency dependence

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
[finders_share](../topics/finders_share.md) is hypothesized to play a major role in shaping group geometry, foraging strategy and feeding competition

### Outcome
Patch finding probability increased for individuals at the front edge of the group but foraging success was higher for individuals at the back of the group where there were fewer conspecifics to join them. [finders_share](../topics/finders_share.md) was smaller when forager density is higher. Individual based models may be a more biologically realistic method for understanding costs and benefits of sociality than game theoretical models that do not incorporate biological phenomena like food detection distance, neighbor distance and [predation](../topics/predation.md) threat
