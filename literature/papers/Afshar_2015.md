### Focus
Testing the linear operator learning rule described in [Afshar_2014](Afshar_2014.md) to determine if increasing the degree of variance in patch quality, while keeping its mean constant, will affect the frequency of scrounging 

### Outcome
As individuals have more experience in the variable environment, they increase their scrounging behaviours. Scrounging is a variance-averse strategy and is less sensitive to changes in patch quality variance than average patch quality. Learning rule models are better tools, to handle complex situations and in their simplicity, to study and predict animal behaviour in frequency-dependent systems than the evolutionarily stable strategy approach. Agent based models using learning rules can incorporate multiple ecological parameters to describe environments more realistically.
