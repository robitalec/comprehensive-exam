The theory of [[risk-sensitive-foraging](../topics/risk-sensitive-foraging.md)] predicts that foragers should respond both to gain and variance. Foragers preferring high variation are risk-prone while those minimizing variance are risk-averse.  

### Strategies
Producers, scroungers

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs
The larger the finder's share, the more the payoff resembles the payoff for a solitary finder

### Penalties

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
Accumulation of gain from producer's share

### Outcome
Within and between patch components of gain variance are larger for producers in groups with scroungers (assuming scroungers are less skilled foragers). If foragers are risk-averse, favoring to minimize variance, we should expect patch-finding skill assorted foraging groups
