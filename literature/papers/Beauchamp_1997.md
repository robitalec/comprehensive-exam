Depletable patches

An individual not influence by conspecifics is expected to aggregate in the richest patches

As conspecific interference increases, individuals are expected to occupy patches of lesser quality corresponding to an equilibrium balancing number of individuals and proportion of individuals in each patch (assuming ideal and free individuals) [Fretwell_and_Lucas_1969](Fretwell_and_Lucas_1969.md)

The ideal free distribution predicts an expected stable distribution without specifying how the distribution arises, the authors here say it must be the consequence of individual adaptive foraging behaviour 

### Strategies
Producers, scroungers. Producers show no conspecific attraction while scroungers would show conspecific attraction

### Frequency dependence
Scrounger payoffs expected to decrease with increasing scrounger frequency in population  

### Payoffs
For the ideal free distribution model, payoffs are equal for all individuals given the distribution of group sizes according to patch quality 

### Penalties

### Resources
Two types of habitats: patches with large number of food items that are not depletable, patches that are quickly depleted 

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access
Travel costs induce foragers to become more sedentary

### Focus
Compare the ideal free distribution model, a model with travel costs and a model with travel costs and conspecific attraction

### Outcome
Interference reduced the average intake rate and increased variation in intake rate across foragers
