- scroungers hop with their heads up and tend to occupy central [spatial-position](../topics/spatial-position.md) in a group (lower predation risk)
- producers hop with their heads down and tend to occupy edge [spatial-position](../topics/spatial-position.md) (higher predation risk)

Predation risk has previously been considered as a potential factor influencing producer scrounger tactic use at the group level. Greater inherent vigilance from having head up compared to head down foraging behaviours. This asymmetry in vigilance has also been suggested as a mechanism for tolerating scroungers [Ranta_1998](Ranta_1998.md). 

### Species
zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata)

### Strategies

### Frequency dependence

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks
Predation simulated by wing-loading manipulations, clipping primary flight feathers

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
Whether increasing an individual's level of predation risk will influence the proportion of time scrounging

### Outcome
Wing-loading manipulations were effective at increasing focal individuals' perception of vulnerability to predation, they increased their total time allocated to vigilance whereas control individuals did not. Experiment found evidence for increasing preference for the scrounger tactic when an individual's predation risk increased but the experiment cannot distinguish between the compatibility between scrounging and antipredator vigilance or spatial position of scroungers within a group.
