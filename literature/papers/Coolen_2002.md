### Species
nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura Punctulata)

### Strategies
Producers, scroungers

### Frequency dependence
Group size

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
Group size influence on proportion scroungers

### Outcome
As group size increased, number of scroungers increased. Patch finding rate decreased as number of scroungers increased.
