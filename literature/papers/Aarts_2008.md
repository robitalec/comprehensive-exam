- data rarely coincide with usage data
- points in space are not all equally accessible to animals
	- assumption that animals have equal access to all points in geographical space equally
	- Johnson 1980 identified accessible space as within an animal's home range
	- mechanistic approach by evaluating if an animal could travel from a starting position to available position through eg. movement speed, travel type (land, water, air) or obstacles
		- represented as a probability density function from which random points can be sampled to construct available set of points
