### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
Empirical test of social foraging tactics of naturally foraging wild chacma baboons

### Outcome
Baboons altered foraging tactics according to [patch-size](../topics/patch-size.md) and [spatial-position](../topics/spatial-position.md) in the group. Scrounging was more common in larger patches and when closer to the center of the group.  Social and reproductive factors can shape producer scrounger dynamics in wild animals living in complex social groups. Among females, individuals were more likely to scrounge from subordinate neighbors with whom they had a strong social affiliation. Females scrounged from males when pregnant and less when fertille.
