if distribution of step distance and turn angle is made at the based on the scale at which data is recorded, this assumptions means we are expecting animals to select at the scale at which data is recorded

if animals are selecting at longer time periods, long-distance decisions

compared long-distance scale and local scale 

found that long distance scale was more important for avoidance behaviours than selecting behaviours in caribou
