### Species
house sparrows (Passer domesticus)

### Strategies

### Frequency dependence

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions
Experimental wind exposure to manipulate overnight energy expenditure of dominant and subordinate individuals

### Access

### Focus
Mutual effects of social dominance and level of energy reserves on the use of social foraging strategies

### Outcome
In response to experimental treatment of wind exposure, dominants used scrounging more frequently while subordinates only had a moderate increase in scrounging
