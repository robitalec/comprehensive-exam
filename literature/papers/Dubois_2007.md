[Information](../topics/information.md) asymmetry concerning resource value among players
Allow finder the opportunity to retaliate if joiner escalates 

Most peaceful food sharing behaviour are not general, involving kin selection or reciprocal altruism

### Strategies
Producer, scrounger, retaliator playing hawk, dove, retaliator. Given asymmetric [information](../topics/information.md), scrounger simply copies finder's choice of hawk or dove, to determine if patch is worth fighting for (using inadvertent social information [Danchin_2004](Danchin_2004.md))

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs

### Penalties

### Availability
Uncertainty about patch [richness](../topics/richness.md)

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
Modify Hawk-Dove game to allow finder the opportunity of retaliating if the joiners escalate and considering the consequences of [information](../topics/information.md) asymmetries concerning resource value among players

### Outcome
Retaliator strategy predicts widespread sharing in habitats where food clumps are of intermediate [richness](../topics/richness.md). When information asymmetry between finder and joiner is created, conditions for sharing are even more easily met and apply to a wider range of resource qualities. This model offers one of the most parsimonious and potentially general evolutionary accounts of the origin of non-aggressive resource sharing. 

Sharing should be more common when resource heterogeneity leads to increased joiner uncertainty.
