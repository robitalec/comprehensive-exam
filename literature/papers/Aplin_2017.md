### Species
great tits (Parus major)

### Strategies

### Frequency dependence
Found a positive relationship between subpopulation size and frequency of scrounging

### Availability
Automated foraging task, no change in availability

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
Personality trait of "exploration behaviour in a novel environment". Five individual level variables were considered as potential predictors of producer scrounger tactics: age, sex, exploratory personality, time of first contact and latency to learn after first contact

### Outcome
Stable dimorphic distribution of producer scrounger tactics in a wild population. Individual specialization on producing and scrounging. Females and adults were more likely to scrounge than males and juveniles. Tolerance in males for female scroungers may be related mating pairs, and dominance of males giving a tendency to produce. Individuals that arrived earlier and learned the task faster were less likely to scrounge.  Scroungers had higher network centrality and larger average group sizes. Individuals tended to be repeatable in their proportion of scrounging.
