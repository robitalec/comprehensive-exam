Two models of producing and scrounging in foraging groups of fixed, finite size:

- producer-priority where scrounging reduces producer's food intake but does not depend on the number of scroungers in the group
- scramble-competition where producer's food intake decreases with the number of scroungers

Stochastic variation incorporated using a variable amount of food found at each patch and a variable allocation of food items to each foraging within patch

### Strategies

### Frequency dependence
Producer-priority model assumes producer's intake does not depend on the number of scroungers whereas scramble-competition model assumes producer's intake decreases with the number of scroungers

### Payoffs

### Penalties

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access
Random patch size and random allocation of food items to each forager at a patch. 



### Focus

### Outcome
