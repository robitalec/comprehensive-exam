Two models of producing and scrounging in foraging groups of fixed, finite size:

- producer-priority where scrounging reduces producer's food intake but does not depend on the number of scroungers in the group
- scramble-competition where producer's food intake decreases with the number of scroungers

Stochastic variation incorporated using a variable amount of food found at each patch and a variable allocation of food items to each foraging within patch

Models presented did not explicitly consider social [dominance](../dominance.md). Variation among individuals in age, size and aggressiveness often leadds to dominance mediated priority of access to resources 

Improvements on assumptions: 

- producer clump discovery rate is constant, though likely producers will have different discovery rates
- producer searching efficiency is constant, though likely searching efficiency will decrease with increasing density of producers
- scroungers may be able to increase their share, decreasing the producer's share

Central premise of producer-scrounger theory is that scrounging depresses producer fitness. If producers suffer a greater predation hazard without scroungers, this may not apply. 

### Strategies

### Frequency dependence
Producer-priority model assumes producer's intake does not depend on the number of scroungers whereas scramble-competition model assumes producer's intake decreases with the number of scroungers

### Payoffs

### Penalties

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access
Random patch size and random allocation of food items to each forager at a patch. 

### Focus

### Outcome
