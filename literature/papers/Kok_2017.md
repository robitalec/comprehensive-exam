### Focus
What is the relationship between food availability, feeding time and [finders_share](../topics/finders_share.md)? Do scrounging herbivores use the [finders_share](../topics/finders_share.md) obtained by a producer as a cue for making patch joining decisions? How does the influence of finder's share on patch joining decisions vary with food availability in a patch?

### Outcome
At low and intermediate food availability, scrounging goats avoided the finder's share patch once the producer had fed for >= 30s. At the highest food availability, scrounging goats joined the producer up to 120s. Food availability and finder's share are both considered by animals making scrounging decisions but finder's share is less important in patches with more food.
