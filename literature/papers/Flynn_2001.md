### Species
spice finches (Lonchura punctulata)

### Strategies
Producers, scroungers

### Frequency dependence

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access
Trained some individuals to produce by teaching them how to find food hidden under lids

### Focus
Do producers and scroungers differ in their spatial position in a group?

### Outcome
Scroungers foraged more often towards the center of the group while producers foraged more often towards the edges of the group. Groups with more scroungers tended to be more compact and densely grouped.
