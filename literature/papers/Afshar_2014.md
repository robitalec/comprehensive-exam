Agent based model using a linear operator learning rule as the decision mechanism

The model provides a unified framework from which to predict the effects on the expected equilibrium of producers and scroungers of group size, metabolic requirement, [finders_share](../topics/finders_share.md), food intake rate, cost of searching, cost of joining, patch encounter rate and patch richness

The simulation results replicate almost every producer scrounger prediction and experimental result published to date, functions better than any single game theoretic model to predict behaviour under frequency-dependent conditions

The authors assume learning, that individuals use their experience of payoffs to decide which tactic to adopt

The linear operator learning rule is the most commonly used learning rule in behavioural ecology. It is simple and has fewer parameters than alternative learning rules. The linear operator, also known as the Rescorla-Wagner rule, uses a matching ratio that allows the individual to sample both tactics and then exploit the best one proportionally more often. 

The stable solution in a more uncertain environment is to scrounge more, only if the average patch richness is large enough to provide a minimum amount of energy required by each individual. Individuals will favor the variance-prone strategy if it offers at a chance of survival
