### Species
tree sparrows (Passer montanus)

### Strategies
Producers, scroungers

### Frequency dependence

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks
Predation risk proxy by modifying the distance between shelter and a feeder

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
Experimentally manipulated effect of predation risk on social foraging tactic use. 

### Outcome
Individual used the scrounging foraging tactic more often when far from cover than close to it. Scrounging was more common in larger groups. Scrounging use in riskier places cannot be simply explained by an additional advantage in increasing antipredator vigilance because at the level of the group, there was no correlation between scrounging and scanning rate. Within groups, a negative correlation was found between scrounging and scanning rate. These results are more similar to Coolen_2001, [Coolen_2003](Coolen_2003.md) rather than [Ranta_1998](Ranta_1998.md). This alternatively may be due to scrounging being a risk averse strategy and due to scrounging being a favored strategy when energy levels are low.
