---
Previous models revealed that evolutionarily stable proportions of scroungers mostly depended on the producer's share of each patch. These models were static and state independent and could not explore whether time of day, animal's state and degree of predation hazard influenced individual decisions to use either strategy

Next steps: incorporate dominance asymmetries and allow foragers the choice to forage alone

### Strategies
Producer, scrounger

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs
When scrounging is rare, it is assumed to do better than the producer alternative because it can take advantage of the many exploitable food patches discovered by the producers. When scrounging is common, the number of individuals competing as scroungers increases and the payoffs for scroungers declines. 

Survival probability is the currency used here instead of net food intake to determine how the use of either strategy impacts individuals' survival probability

### Penalties
The nighttime non foraging period reduces animal's energy reserves that are replenished during daylight. Foraging increases risk of predation while resting decreases risk of predation while consuming energy 

### Resources


### Risks
Predation / hazard risk. Scroungers surveying for producers finding patches also provides a lower predation hazard as a by-product and to include this, the authors set the predation hazard for scroungers to half that of the  producers.

### Conditions

### Access
All scroungers get equal access to each producer's patch minus the producer's share. Patch-finding rate and amount of food in a patch were constant. Varying patchiness did not change the average daily stable proportion of scrounging but increasing patchiness decreased the probability of survival in most cases. 

### Focus
State-dependent dynamic producer-scrounger game that predicts early in the day when energy reserves are low, individuals will prefer the scrounger strategy. Late in the day, individuals will favor the producer strategy. Under rich and clumped food, scrounging will improve daily survival of all group members. 

### Outcome
Increasing predation hazard decreased survival. 

The proportion of individuals scrounging is predicted to through the day, highest around dawn and dusk and lowest around midday because the scrounger obtains small amounts of food in a reliable way while the producer either acquires high or no food intake.
