Typically assumption is that individuals that do not possess a resource and must decide whether to attempt aggressive appropriation of another individual's resource face the same economic decision as those that already have possession of a resource and must decide whether to defend against an appropriator's attack

The authors argue there is a asymmetry in resource defense vs appropriation

Models either use appropriators assuming they are never aggressive ([Vickery_1991](Vickery_1991.md)) or always aggressive (Broom_1998)

[Predation](../topics/predation.md) risk should not effect foraging tactic use unless one of the foraging tactics is  disproportionately exposed to [predation](../topics/predation.md) than the other 

### Strategies
Producers, scroungers playing hawks, doves

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs

### Penalties
Energetic cost of fight, mean contest duration, density of predators, risk of being killed by a predator during an escalated fight

### Availability
Patch density, patch [richness](../topics/richness.md)

### Resources

### Risks
[Predation](../topics/predation.md) hazard

### Conditions

### Access
Group size

### Focus
How changes in group size, clump density, patch [richness](../topics/richness.md) and [predation](../topics/predation.md) hazards affect both decision to appropriate and defend a resource and interact to predict effects on the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness of individuals

### Outcome
Producer challenged by a scrounger should always aggressively defend clumps whereas only a fraction of scroungers should attempt to aggressively appropriate a producer's food. This is due to the [finders_share](../topics/finders_share.md) that lets producers pay more for defense than a scrounger can for appropriation. 

Increasing group size will increase the rate of playing scrounger and increase the costs of aggression. Few scroungers are expected at the equilibrium when the number of foragers is small. 

Increasing patch density will reduce the time required for producers to find patches and the temporal costs associated with aggressive appropriation will make scrounger less profitable. Encounters will decline as the number of producers increases. 

Increasing patch [richness](../topics/richness.md) will increase the scrounger's share and the proportion of scroungers within the group. Scroungers are more likely to get required food to offset expenses of aggressive appropriation. 

Costs of aggression increase with [predation](../topics/predation.md) pressure as the increased probability of being killed by a predator while engaged in a fight increase. Aggression should reduce when [predation](../topics/predation.md) hazard increases but non-aggressive scroungers will be unsuccessful securing food from aggressive producers. Otherwise, scroungers are likely to switch to producing, reducing the proportion of scroungers and decreasing the number of challenges but with lower numbers of scroungers, the aggressiveness increases.
