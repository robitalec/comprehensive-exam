Vultures appear to keep in visual contact with conspecifics and when one vulture discovers a carcass, it creates a local enhancement effect. If vulture populations decline, it can decrease foraging efficiency as the network of connected vultures is less effective at detecting carrion

Authors if there were interspecific producer scrounger dynamics between vultures and eagles using video footage of placed carcasses

### Focus
Determine if there are interspecific producer scrounger dynamics between eagles and vultures. 

### Outcome
Social information transfer can occur across species and ecosystem-based management is critical considering vulture populations suffering global declines
