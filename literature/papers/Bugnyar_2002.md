Ravens scavenge from ephemeral carcasses or kills, or at regular food supplies in game parks or garbage dumps. Food sources are often defended by dominant conspecifics or potential predators (eg. wolves). Group formation may benefit ravens in overcoming food defence but may also increase competition. 

### Species
ravens (Corvus corax), wolves (Canis lupus) wild boars (Sus scrofa)

### Strategies
Producers (directly from source), scroungers (stealing from a conspecific)

### Frequency dependence

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks
Predation risk by wolves

### Conditions

### Access
Variable depending on either wolves or boars

### Focus
Examine raven foraging tactics considering [interspecific](../topics/interspecific.md) competition with wolves who may aggressively defend their food and kill ravens, and wild boars who do not. Producing where there are wolves should be more risky and ravens should favor scrounging. Where there are wild boars, ravens should produce more than where there are wolves. Also consider age, dominance and affiliative relationships within species. 

### Outcome
Predation risk at the feeding site affects ravens' decision whether or not to scrounge in competition for food. Scrounging was more common among wolves than with wild boars. Scrounging strategy was influenced by dominance. Displacing others was typically shown by dominants whereas stealing was typically shown by subordinates. Food sharing only occurred in ravens at different stages of pair bonding (social affiliation) indicated by mutual preening or resting in close proximity. Displacing was twice as profitable as stealing or sharing.
