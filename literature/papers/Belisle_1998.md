[interspecific](../topics/interspecific.md) empirical studdy of jaegers kleptoparasitizing terns carrying fish

By being attracted to producers, scroungers induce group formation. Producer-scrounger systems may be the cause of foraging group formation and not a consequence of animal aggregation

### Strategies

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs
Probability of obtaining a fish, gross rate of energy intake, net rate of energy intake and energy efficiency

### Penalties

### Resources
Nested 

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
Consider four general forgaing group size moddels and their respective set of predictions relative to group size in an environment of two nested relative patch scales

### Outcome
All currencies decreased with group size except for the probability of obtaining a fish
