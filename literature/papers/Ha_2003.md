### Species
crows (Corvus caurinus)

### Strategies
Producers, scroungers

### Frequency dependence
Group size

### Availability

### Resources
Discrete items with handling times ranging from near zero to tens of seconds. Items could not be shared. 

### Risks

### Conditions
Air temperature, time of day, season (breeding vs nonbreeding)

### Access

### Focus
Individual variability in foraging strategy use, variables influencing [[finders_share](../topics/finders_share.md)] and costs and benefits of producing and scrounging

### Outcome
Individuals were likely to use both producer and scrounger strategies rather than to be pure prodducers. Larger prey items or those with longer handling times were most likely to be stolen. No ecological factors, age or sex influenced the probability of retaining prey.
