Resource Holding Potential (RHP) influences both outcome of a potential aggressive contest and influences how an individual values a particular resource
Dominant individuals have the most mating opportunities and individuals at the top of the hierarchy often fight as the difference between first and second is large, whereas individuals lower in the hierarchy don't bother fighting since the difference between their positions is negligible. Winners and losers effects. 


### Strategies
Producers, scroungers

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs
Value of resource

### Penalties
Conflict cost

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions
Seasonal scarcity of resources leading to stealing when food is rare but not when food is common

### Access
1 Scrounger does not attempt to steal, 2 scroungers attempts to steal and producer defends, 3 scrounger attempts to steal and producer does not defend

### Focus
Model stealing interactions under asymmetric food valuation

### Outcome
Differences between individuals in resource holding potential  affects their changes of winning a conflict and how much they value a particular resource. Strong effect of the relationship between resource holding potential and the value of resources on how much aggressive behaviour occurs in the population. This results in fights occurring mainly between strong individuals or between weak individuals. For example, if a weak individual is struggling to survive, it will attribute high value to the resource and fight where a strong individual will not defend.
