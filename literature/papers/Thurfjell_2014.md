compared to RSFs, step selection functions:

- linking successive animal locations as steps
- random steps start at the observed location and end at a point defined by a random draw from step distance and turn angle distributions
- objective is how covariates affect selection of steps
- movement constrains availability and selection


selection of step length distance and turn angle is likely to be the most critical aspect of SSFs

number of random steps 


habitat use patterns can vary seasonally, daily or across years

selecting the appropriate scale:

- compare alternative models using different spatial and temporal scales

grain or resolution of spatial variables can have consequences on inference if selection occurs at a scale smaller than the resolution of the data. animals
