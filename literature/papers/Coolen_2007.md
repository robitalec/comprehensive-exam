Scrounging behaviour can affect both demographic parameters and population dynamics including the stability of interactions with prey



### Strategies
Producers, scroungers

### Frequency dependence
Group size

### Payoffs

### Penalties

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
Influence of scrounging behaviour on demographic parameters and population dynamics

### Outcome
Scrounging can act as a population regulator through its effects on individuals' reproductive rate and mortality. Presence of scrounging predators allows an increased predator population size and contributes to the regulation of both predator and prey populations.
