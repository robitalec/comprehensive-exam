Cost functions can be 

- convex cost functions where alpha is greater than 1 represent where major cost is risk of injury or lost energy. A small investment in the fight are cheap but enlarging an already large investment is very costly 
- concave cost functions where alpha is less than 1 represent where time costs are the biggest problems eg. due to exposure of [predation](../topics/predation.md) risk. A small investment in the fight is relatively costly but enlarging an already large investment is relatively inexpensive
 

### Strategies

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs

### Penalties
Individual choose to invest an amount of energy into contests and level of investment of each individual determines probability it will win contest, and additional cost it has to bear. Cost function either convex or concave

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks
Risk of injury or lost energy for convex cost functions, predation risk for concave cost functions

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
Extend previous models that consider a discrete set of options for gaining resources eg. steal or not, or play hawk or dove in a contest, to consider a continuous measure of effort invested following a particular cost function. 

### Outcome
For high levels of maximum investment, the producer keeps the resource without a fight for concave cost functions but for convex functions the scrounger obtains the resource at some cost.
