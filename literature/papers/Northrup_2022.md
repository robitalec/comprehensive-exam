> accessibility driven by an animal’s perceptual range or cognitive map, physical constraints on distance moved, evolutionary history, social structure, and any other process  that limits the ability of an animal to access a location at  a given time

often definitions of available distribution are meant to capture one of the four orders of selection [Johnson_1980](Johnson_1980.md)

recommend sensitivity analyses since accessibility and [availability](../topics/availability.md) will never be known

> Including distance as a covariate in selection  functions can also facilitate simultaneous estimation of  movement and habitat-selection processes by integrated  step-selection analyses (iSSAs; Avgar et al. 2016, Fieberg  et al. 2021)
