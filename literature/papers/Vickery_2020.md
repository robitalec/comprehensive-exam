Extends the model of [Coolen_2007](Coolen_2007.md) by adding an additional level to the food chain

Predator interacts with its prey under a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. Without scrounging, the parsimonious model produces only neutral stability with limit cycles between predator and prey. [Coolen_2007](Coolen_2007.md) showed that the presence of scrounging in the predator population process a stable predator-prey equilibrium and that as the frequency of scrounging in the population increases, the equilibrium density of both prey and predators should also increase. 



### Strategies
Producers and scroungers, scrounging only occurs in the top predator. When scrounging is introduced in intermediate predator population, the dynamics in the top predator are not stabilized due to a lack of negative feedback on prey consumption. 

### Frequency dependence
Predator density

### Payoffs
Resources, finder's share

### Penalties
Mortality rate of predators

### Availability

### Resources
Resources with an intrinsic rate of growth

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access
Encounter rate between predators and prey

### Focus
Behaviour at the individual level having effects on populations, food chains and community structure

### Outcome
The addition of scrounging in consumer populations can allow multiple consumers to coexist while exploiting a single prey. Scrounging in the top predator of a tritrophic food chain can stabilize interactions between the top predator, its prey and its prey's prey. Presence of scroungers reduces the total amount of resource acquired by the group. Scrounging limits group size, impact on prey and ability of a predator to outcompete other species, promoting stability and species diversity. 

Higher growth rates of the resource require high scrounging frequencies to prevent instability on the system. Low growth rates allow coexistence only when the finder's advantage is high and scrounging frequency is low. If encounter rate is high, scrounging will be rare. 

Scrounging will not stabilize population dynamics, food chains and competitor interactions under all cases. If scrounging is too prevalent, it can push the population to extinction. Other factors such as food abundance, variations in weather, predators and parasites may have stronger effects that can completely obscure the effects of scrounging.
