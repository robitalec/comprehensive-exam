Reconcile information-sharing and [producer-scrounger](../topics/producer-scrounger.md) models of group foraging

[information-sharing-models](../topics/information-sharing-models.md) have examined how group size influences the rate of food discovery. Concerned with the functional advantage of sociality. Assume all individuals search independently while simultaneously observing each other. When a patch is found, all individuals feed on it. This assumption if called complete compatibility. 

Unlike [[information-sharing-models](../topics/information-sharing-models.md)], [producer-scrounger](../topics/producer-scrounger.md) models do not assume all group members behave in the same way. Some individuals specialize in producing and others in scrounging. At a given play of the game, a producer cannot scrounger and a scrounger cannot produce. This assumption is called complete incompatibility. 

These two extremes are likely unrealistic with partial compatibility being more likely. Trading off predator [vigilance](../topics/vigilance.md) and feeding rate, and specializing on particular forage types. 

### Strategies

- [producers](../topics/producers.md)
- [scroungers](../topics/scroungers.md)
- [opportunists](../topics/opportunists.md) (can produce or scrounge at a reduced efficiency)

### Frequency dependence

- effective group size
- patch discovery rate decreased with less producers
- scrounger's portion decreases for each patch with more [scroungers](../topics/scroungers.md)

### Payoffs

- scarce patches of divisible food items
- long search time relative to patch exploitation time
- finder's share

### Penalties

### Resources

Patchy [resources](../topics/resources.md) may lead to larger group size and more [scroungers](../topics/scroungers.md)

### Risks

### Conditions

Reduction of sensory contact between individuals, eg. wind or fog, likely reduce group size and favor increased proportion of [producers](../topics/producers.md)

### Access

Assumed that [producers](../topics/producers.md) have a finder's share before [scroungers](../topics/scroungers.md) and opportunities arrive at the patch. The remainder is divided equally between the producer and all [scroungers](../topics/scroungers.md) (including [opportunists](../topics/opportunists.md)), where the total consumed by [scroungers](../topics/scroungers.md) is the scrounger's share.

Solitary foraging could be a solution for [producers](../topics/producers.md) to avoid sharing with [scroungers](../topics/scroungers.md). This may not be possible when food is localized and presence of others cannot be escaped. Trade off of others balanced with [predation](../topics/predation.md) risk. 

### Focus

Reconcile information-sharing and [producer-scrounger](../topics/producer-scrounger.md) models of group foraging

### Outcome

These three [strategies](../topics/strategies.md) can only coexist when opportunist's loss in searching ability is exactly equal to its gain in scrounging ability. All pairs of [strategies](../topics/strategies.md) can coexist, depending on relative producing ability and relative scrounging ability of [opportunists](../topics/opportunists.md) and the finder's share.
