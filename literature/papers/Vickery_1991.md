Reconcile information-sharing and producer-scrounger models of group foraging

[information-sharing-models](../topics/information-sharing-models.md) have examined how group size influences the rate of food discovery. Concerned with the functional advantage of sociality. Assume all individuals search independently while simultaneously observing each other. When a patch is found, all individuals feed on it. This assumption if called complete compatibility. 

Unlike [[information-sharing-models](../topics/information-sharing-models.md)], [producer-scrounger](../topics/producer-scrounger.md) models do not assume all group members behave in the same way. Some individuals specialize in producing and others in scrounging. At a given play of the game, a producer cannot scrounger and a scrounger cannot produce. This assumption is called complete incompatibility. 

These two extremes are likely unrealistic with partial compatibility being more likely. Trading off predator vigilance and feeding rate, and specializing on particular forage types. 

### Strategies

- producers
- scroungers
- opportunists (can produce or scrounge at a reduced efficiency)

### Frequency dependence

- effective group size
- patch discovery rate decreased with less producers
- scrounger's portion decreases for each patch with more scroungers

### Payoffs

- scarce patches of divisible food items
- long search time relative to patch exploitation time
- finder's share

### Penalties

### Resources

Patchy resources may lead to larger group size and more scroungers

### Risks

### Conditions

Reduction of sensory contact between individuals, eg. wind or fog, likely reduce group size and favor increased proportion of producers

### Access

Assumed that producers have a finder's share before scroungers and opportunities arrive at the patch. The remainder is divided equally between the producer and all scroungers (including opportunists), where the total consumed by scroungers is the scrounger's share.

Solitary foraging could be a solution for producers to avoid sharing with scroungers. This may not be possible when food is localized and presence of others cannot be escaped. Trade off of others balanced with [predation](../topics/predation.md) risk. 

### Focus

Reconcile information-sharing and producer-scrounger models of group foraging

### Outcome

These three strategies can only coexist when opportunist's loss in searching ability is exactly equal to its gain in scrounging ability. All pairs of strategies can coexist, depending on relative producing ability and relative scrounging ability of opportunists and the finder's share.
