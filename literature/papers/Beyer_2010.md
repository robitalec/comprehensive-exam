- [habitat](../topics/habitat.md): regions in environmental space
- use: proportion of time an animal spends in a [habitat](../topics/habitat.md)
- selection: process by which animals actively choose [habitat](../topics/habitat.md). Considered selective if use is disproportional to available. Different than preference because selection is a behavioural process
- [availability](../topics/availability.md): amount of a [habitat](../topics/habitat.md) available to an animal
- preference: use is greater than available, different than selection because preference is a statistical description 
- accessibility ([access](../topics/access.md)): ease with which an individual can reach a point in space. a complex function of social, interspecific and environmental factors that might limit access to habitat in geographical space. Not easily quantified


behaviour is how animals manage their fitness in dynamic and heterogeneous environments

presence or occupancy does not imply selection

activity patterns and habitat use can vary diurnally and seasonally 

availability can be quantified at many spatial and temporal scales

one way of quantifying availability is to use a movement model which can include many factors that influence accessibility and weight availability by an estimate of their accessibility

given the preference is defined conditionally on the availability, there are a number of challenges:

- Positive (or negative) preference for a given habitat  implies only that the habitat is used ore (or less) frequently than expected by chance, conditional upon the  defined sample of availability
- The sign and magnitude of the estimate of  preference is a function of both the sample of use  and the sample of availability. This creates an identifiability problem because reference can change as a  function of changing use and/or changing availability.  If the sample of availability differs between two  estimates of preference, it is meaningless to draw inferences based on the difference in preference
- preference is not necessarily correlated with the value of the habitat to an animal, and cannot be used to gauge relative importance of different habitat
- a coefficient near zero may indicate selection for the habitat occurs at other levels of availability
