- [habitat](../topics/habitat.md): regions in environmental space
- use: proportion of time an animal spends in a [habitat](../topics/habitat.md)
- selection: process by which animals actively choose [habitat](../topics/habitat.md). Considered selective if use is disproportional to available. Different than preference because selection is a behavioural process
- [availability](../topics/availability.md): amount of a [habitat](../topics/habitat.md) available to an animal
- preference: use is greater than available, different than selection because preference is a statistical description 
- accessibility ([access](../topics/access.md)): ease with which an individual can reach a point in space. a complex function of social, interspecific and environmental factors that might limit access to habitat in geographical space. Not easily quantified


behaviour is how animals manage their fitness in dynamic and heterogeneous environments

presence or occupancy does not imply selection

activity patterns and habitat use can vary diurnally and seasonally 

availability can be quantified at many spatial and temporal scales

one way of quantifying availability is to use a movement model which can include many factors that influence accessibility and weight availability by an estimate of their accessibility
