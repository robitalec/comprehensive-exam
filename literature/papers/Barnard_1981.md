Developed a mathematical model then tested with captive flocks of house sparrows

In the simplest form, the payoff to scroungers increases with the number of producers as the number of opportunities to parasitize increases. The payoff for producers decreases with increasing number of scroungers as more of their investment is shared with or lost to scroungers. 

### Strategies

- scroungers acquired most of their food by interaction
- producers acquired most of their food by actively foraging

interactions:


- age
- individual capibility eg. size
- initernal state eg. hunger

### Frequency dependence

- frequency of strategies
- group size

### Payoffs

- model: amount of any particular resource
- empirical: mealworm capture rate

as density increases,
- thermal insulation
- protection from predators

### Penalties

- high density of producers may lead to competition or interference

### Resources

- nests
- food 
- mates

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access

- scroungers did better when one or more producers were present
- scroungers did much worse when greatly outnumbered by producers, possibly because available food was found very quickly

### Focus

### Outcome

Model predicts that groups will reach an evolutionary equilibrium when the payoff to producers and scroungers is equal. Group stability will depend on the ratio of producers to scroungers.
