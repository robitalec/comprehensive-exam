> To evaluate this possibility, we re-assess previously developed habitat-use models for abundance  of males of three grassland birds by explicitly including two measures of selection behavior: the “propensity to aggregate” and “propensity to use social [information](../topics/information.md).” Habitat-use models for Nelson’s Sharp-tailed Sparrow  (Ammodramus nelsoni) were not improved by either behavioral variable. However, models for two other species,  the Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) and Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), improved substantially through reduced prediction error (assessed with cross-validation) and were much more likely to be an appropriate model (by reducing the deviance of the fitted models). These results indicate that habitat-selection models  can be an improvement over correlative habitat-use models. In our case, these improvements were limited to two  species in which individuals use their conspecifics as cues of local habitat quality.
