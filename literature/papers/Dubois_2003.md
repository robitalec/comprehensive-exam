Animals in groups often use [scramble-competition](../topics/scramble-competition.md) or contest tactics to obtain food at clumps found by others. 

Modeled as hawk dove game

- alpha: finder's advantage
- F: number of indivisible items
- C: cost of fighting


### Strategies

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs
Resources for scrounger are what remains minus finder's share

### Penalties
Energetic costs of fighting

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
Reconcile differences between optimality approach used to predict economic defendability of resources and game theoretic approach

### Outcome
Aggression should always decrease as the density and [richness](../topics/richness.md) of food clumps increases. The dove is never an ESS. Some animals share food clumps without any overt aggression, and this may be due to iterated play among familiar players
