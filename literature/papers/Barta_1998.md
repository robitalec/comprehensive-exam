Impact of [dominance](../topics/dominance.md) depends on  food [distribution](../topics/distribution.md) and defendability eg. evenly distributed food, large [patch-size](../topics/patch-size.md) is difficult to defend whereas small, high value patches are easier to defend

Competitive ability depends on [dominance](../topics/dominance.md)

### Strategies
Producers, scroungers

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs

### Penalties

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access
Priority access to resources depending on [dominance](../topics/dominance.md) rank. After finder's share, remainder divided among scroungers. 

### Focus
How differences in [dominance](../topics/dominance.md) influence individual's decision to play producer or scrounger

### Outcome
As finder's share increases, proportion of scroungers decreases. At similar [dominance](../topics/dominance.md) ranks, individuals should all equally play scrounger. At asymmetrical [dominance](../topics/dominance.md) ranks, superior individuals should use mostly scrounging while inferior individuals should use mostly producing. Only when competitive differences are very large, eg. a dominant individual can monopolize the whole or most of a patch, should individuals specialize exclusively in one role (dominants - scrounge, subordinates - produce)
