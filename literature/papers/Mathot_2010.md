Allowing kin to exploit one's efforts may be less costly than allowing exploitation by nonkin. There may be higher frequencies of exploitation among related individuals

> In scrounger-controlled systems, the general  
finding for organisms ranging from bacteria to higher verte-  
brates is that increasing [relatedness](../topics/relatedness.md) among group members  
decreases the frequency of exploitation (Buss 1982; Schneider  
1996; Zink 2000; Semel and Sherman 2001; Hudson et al.  
2002; Griffin et al. 2004; Castillo et al. 2005; Fiegna and  
Velicer 2005; Diggle et al. 2007; Schneider and Bilde 2008).  
However, in producer-controlled systems higher levels of ex-  
ploitative behaviors can be favored in kin groups (Andersson  
2001; Lo ́pez-Sepulcre and Kokko 2002)


Simplification that groups included all kin or all nonkin. See Toth_2009, Ha_2003, Aviles_2004

Producer-controlled and scrounger-controlled joining


### Strategies
[Producers](../topics/producers.md), [scroungers](../topics/scroungers.md)

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs

### Penalties
[Aggression](../topics/aggression.md) from [producers](../topics/producers.md) towards [scroungers](../topics/scroungers.md), different depending on kin and nonkin

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access
Differential tolerance towards scrounging by kin and nonkin 

### Focus
Do [producers](../topics/producers.md) allow kin to scrounge more frequently?

### Outcome
Model predicts increased [relatedness](../topics/relatedness.md) can lead to higher levels of exploitation when [producers](../topics/producers.md) are kin-selected to be more tolerant of scrounging from relatives compared with non relatives, eg. being more aggressive towards nonkin. Empirical tests in this study with zebra finches had higher frequencies of scrounging and lower levels of aggressive interactions when finches were related compared to when finches were unrelated.
