Assumption that scrounger chooses strategy before the joiner

Assumption that finder's share is uniformly distributed eg scavenging a carcass and not a diminishing rate over time eg capture of small prey items like ants

### Strategies
Producers, scroungers

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs
[Information](../topics/information.md) about food patch, [finders_share](../topics/finders_share.md)

### Penalties
Energetic cost of contest, probability that producer will win contest

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
Consider a producer scrounger game where the producer knows the value of the remaining food patch but the scrounger does not

### Outcome
The extra [information](../topics/information.md) held by the producer can be both beneficial and harmful. Examples where [information](../topics/information.md) is not available to scrounger include resources not immediately visible eg. concealed nests, or where contest occurs quickly after the patch is discovered, not allowing sufficient time for producer to evaluate the patch. 

Where costs of contests are high, or if joiner only has a small chance of winning the contest eg if the patch is easily defended, the producer should play hawk and the scrounger should play dove leaving the producer with the resource without contest. 

When the scrounger's potential cost is small compared to the value of the food or if the scrounger's change of winning is high, the scrounger will always fight.
