Paradox of enrichment where enrichment of prey can generate large amplitude limit cycles causing high risk of extinction

Extends the model of [Coolen_2007](Coolen_2007.md) to one prey and two prey systems


### Strategies
Producers, scroungers

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs

### Penalties

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
Predator population in which individuals play a producer scrounger game to analyse the stability of a coexisting equilibrium point in one prey system and non equilibrium dynamics in two prey system. 

### Outcome
Social foraging can stabilize both one prey and two prey systems and resolve the paradox of enrichment when scrounging is prevalent in predators. Scrounging can lower the growth rate of a population allowing the prey resource to persist at higher densities than if scrounging was absent.
