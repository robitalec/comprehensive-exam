### Focus
Tested that [energy-reserves](../topics/energy-reserves.md) will affect exploratory behaviour using tree sparrows in fasted and fed states exploring a novel space with hidden food in different patch [distribution](../topics/distribution.md) patterns. 

### Outcome
Sparrows in fed and fasted states did not differ in feeding rates in either patch pattern. Fasted sparrows risked being more exploratory and stayed longer on the ground. Fasted sparrows discovered more patches and consumed more food than fed sparrows in dispersed patch patterns. Fed birds also increased patch finding to a plateau in dispersed patch patterns.
