[payoffs](../topics/payoffs.md) and [penalties](../topics/penalties.md) beyond food intake rate also include mortality risk from predation, tradeoff between minimizing predation hazard and foraging decisions 

Optimal strategy (following Gilliam_1987) is one that minimizes the ratio of mortality rate to feeding rate

### Strategies
Producers, scroungers

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs

### Penalties

### Resources

### Risks
Predation

### Conditions

### Access
Finder's share

### Focus
Differences between producers and scroungers in vigilance level and vulnerability to predators

ESS group combinations of producer and scrounger strategies

### Outcome
Scroungers contribute to group vigilance, and therefore pay for their "free meal"
