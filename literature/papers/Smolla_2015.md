Animals gain [information](../topics/information.md) by directly interacting with their environment (individual learning) or by observing others (social learning)

Social learning has benefits including learning behaviours that have been tested and retained by others, with an expectation that these have higher returns than untested behaviours. 

Results are consistent with empirical studies of sticklebacks, honeybees, rats and goats



### Strategies

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs

### Penalties

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access
Within patch resource collection by individuals was assumed to be restricted to strictly independent or competitive, and not cooperative

### Focus
Model of social learning incorporating competition 

### Outcome
Social learning is favored when competition is weak but if competition is strong, social learning is only favored when the resource quality if highly variable and there is low environmental turnover
