When learning arises in a group, it can often reduce the opportunity for learning in naive individuals leading to a stable polymorphism of knowledgeable and naive individuals

Learning is predicted to be most useful when conditions vary

This study is not addressing how learning proceeds, it does not consider the number of experiences an animal requires to estimate payoffs of alternative choices, or how memory windows are related. It only considers the outcome of a potentially instantaneous learning rule. Other costs of learning involve sampling leading to inefficient foraging, and the metabolic or energetic costs of maintaining the learning physiology

Personality polymorphisms are thought to be maintained as the consequence of strong trade-offs between benefits and costs across ecological contexts and different selective forces acting at different times during an organism's life history. The need to make repeated foraging strategy decisions is probably sufficient to predict the learning polymorphisms. Personality types eg bold/shy, proactive/reactive, fast/slow explorers may all be descriptors of behaviours that correspond to stable and widespread learning-non-learning dimorphism. If this is correct, the authors predict the differences in learning ability are the cause, rather than the consequence, of personality traits and that learning ability will be greatest in species that commonly engage in repetitive decision-making games. 

### Strategies
Producers, scroungers

### Frequency dependence
Payoffs are highly negatively frequency-dependent such that scrounger do better than producers when scroungers are rare and scroungers do worse than producers when scroungers are common. Number of foragers in group.

### Payoffs
Patch quality, [finders_share](../topics/finders_share.md)

### Penalties

### Availability

### Resources
Changing environments

### Risks

### Conditions

### Access
Patch encounter rate

### Focus
Whether a learning mutant that can optimize its use of producer and scrounger to local conditions can invade a population of non-learning individuals that play producer and scrounger with fixed probabilities

### Outcome
Learning provides an initial advantage but never evolves to fixation. At a stable equilibrium, the population is made up of a majority of fixed players and a minority of learning players.
