Assume that scroungers get a share of all patches (though this could not occur in reality since individuals cannot be in multiple places at a time)

### Strategies
Producers, scroungers

### Frequency dependence

### Payoffs
Resource, [finders_share](../topics/finders_share.md)

### Penalties

### Availability

### Resources

### Risks
Predation

### Conditions

### Access

### Focus
What is the effect of multiple simultaneous opportunities to scrounge on tactic use

### Outcome
Rate of scrounging should increase with the number of simultaneous opportunities. When food is clumped into few rich patches rather than dispersed into many poor patches, the number of scroungers should increase. When risk of predation is lower, producing is favoured. When the probability of finding patches decreases with increasing forager density, larger groups should have more scroungers. When the probability of finding patches increases with increasing forager density, larger groups should have less scroungers.
