## C1: Concepts, definitions, methods

Social foraging differs from individual foraging theory in that it requires economic interdependence of payoffs and penalties. An individual's foraging behaviour and its functional consequence depends on the actions of the individual and the behaviour of other foragers. The majority of this book's attention is on consequences for individuals with some on communities. 

Comparing individual foraging theory, eg. Stephens_and_Krebs_1986, to social foraging theory

| Prey selection strategy for an individual involves attack probabilities for different prey and net rate of intake | Added complexity of considering 2+ predators for a shared clump of prey |

Social criterion: 2+ individuals concurrently influence each other's gains and losses

Historically, social groups are defined as individuals that derive evolutionary advantages from the presence of others while aggregations do not. Genuine attraction between individuals vs merely statistical coincidence. 

This obscures the similarities between animals with complex social structures and those without. Eg. lions (complex) and pigeons (simpler/loose) both have food available to an individual dependent on the number of foragers in the group. Regardless of however "social" they can both be modelled with a similar social foraging model. 

Social foraging theory is not the study of the origin of foraging groups. Social foraging does not treat antipredatory and energetic benefits as competing causes. Both are integrated into the currency of fitness. 

Approaches to social foraging theory:

- comparative method correlating ecological conditions to population/species attributes
- optimization techniques
	- criticisms: Cohen_1976, Launde_1982, Gray_1987, Hines_1987
	- responses: Maynard_Smith_1978, Oster_Wislson_1978, Mayr_1983, Krebs_Davies_1984, Stephens_Krebs_1986, Schoener_1987

Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies (one for each player) such that no player can improve its payoff by changing strategy vs the other Nash equilibrium strategies. Nash equilibriums are stable if unilateral deviation reduces payoff. 

An [evolutionary-stable-strategy](../topics/evolutionary-stable-strategy.md) maximizes a player's expected payoff. Stability may imply dynamics resistant to invasion by a rare strategy, or the consequences for an individual deviating from the [evolutionary-stable-strategy](../topics/evolutionary-stable-strategy.md). All [evolutionary-stable-strategy](../topics/evolutionary-stable-strategy.md) are Nash equilibriums. 

- Strategies may be
	- directly equivalent to alleles 
	- modified by the environment
	- Pure strategies are where there is a single action
- Populations may be 
	- finite
	- infinite
- Play may be
	- repeated or not (single round)
	- informed or uninformed where each player chooses their action without knowledge of the action other players will take
- Games 
	- Symmetric where there is competitive equivalence of players with the same payoffs and penalties. No phenotypic attributes of individuals. 
	- Discrete where each action is from a discrete set

This complexity has theoretical significance. The authors' recommendation is to focus on phenotype. Assume selection has enhanced learning capacity and individuals can efficiently vary behaviour across environmental and social conditions. 

Box 1.1 Classes of behaviours that may occur among social foragers

1. Selfish behaviour (positive effect on individual and negative on relatives)
2. Cooperative behaviour
	1. Group selected altruism
	2. Unconditional cooperation
		1. Kin-directed altruism (negative or neutral effect on individual and positive effect on relatives)
		2. Mutualism (positive effect on individual and relatives)
	3. Conditional cooperation
		1. Reciprocal altruism 
		2. Conditional mutualism

Searching

- at least some group members attempt to find food
- others may avoid the cost of searching
- active foragers may focus on different resources
- time to locate patch depends on the number of individuals searching and their interacting efficiencies
- food searching is treated as stochastic

Dividing

- food is actively shared, divided equally
- allocated asymmetrically according to eg. dominance status

Three types of social foragers

1. Producers: search environment for food
2. Scroungers: do not search directly. They attend to other forager's clump discoveries and aggressively or stealthily sequester some food
3. Opportunist: both search directly and obtain food at clumps located by producers or opportunists. They are assumed less efficient than producers and scroungers. 

Interactions between types of social foragers

- Producer vs producer: equilibrium group size under controlled group-entry
- Producer vs scrounger: require some number of producers, depends on the cost of scrounging
- Producer vs opportunist: this interaction is not maintained under symmetric competition (Pulliam_and_Caraco_1984). Greater dominance status for opportunists or more efficient searching by producers will favor one or the other type. 
- Opportunist vs opportunist: information-sharing systems, equivalent to group size under free entry
- Scrounger vs opportunist: can persist due to knowledge limitation
